refibrillation managed by emt-ds : incidence and outcome without paramedic back-up . some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians ( emt-ds ) will refibrillate before hospital arrival . the authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by emt-ds working without paramedic back-up . of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms , 19 ( 17 % ) refibrillated , 11 ( 58 % ) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms , including nine of 11 ( 82 % ) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation . among patients initially converted to organized rhythms , hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not ( 53 % versus 76 % , p = ns ) , although discharge rates were virtually identical ( 37 % and 35 % , respectively ) . scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome . defibrillation-trained emts can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available . 
tricyclic antidepressant overdose : emergency department findings as predictors of clinical course . there is controversy regarding the appropriate utilization of health care resources in the management of tricyclic antidepressant overdosage . antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department ( ed ) are routinely admitted to intensive care units , but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment . the authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ed with antidepressant overdose . they found that major manifestations of toxicity on ed evaluation ( altered mental status , seizures , arrhythmias , and conduction defects ) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course . patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or qtc prolongation had no complications . no patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ed evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course . these data support the concept that proper ed evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation . 
transconjunctival oxygen monitoring as a predictor of hypoxemia during helicopter transport . as the use of helicopters for air transport of critically ill patients increases , the availability of monitoring devices for physiological parameters during flight becomes important . it has long been known that arterial po2 ( pao2 ) decreases during unsupplemented , non-pressurized flight . in this study , the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen ( cjo2 ) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers . arterial pao2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjo2 at ground level , 5 , 000 feet , and 10 , 000 feet altitude . mean pao2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm hg , respectively ( p less than 0.001 , analysis of variance with repeated measures ) . mean cjo2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm hg , respectively ( p less than 0.001 , analysis of variance with repeated measures ) . within individual subjects , cjo2 was an accurate predictor of pao2 ( p less than 0.001 , multiple regression analysis ) . the relationship between cjo2 and pao2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147 . the authors conclude that the transconjunctival o2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients . the results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport . 
serum glucose changes after administration of 50 % dextrose solution : pre- and in-hospital calculations . a prospective clinical trial was conducted to estimate the rise in serum glucose level after an intravenous bolus of 50 ml of 50 % dextrose solution ( d-50 ) in the emergency department setting . fifty one subjects with altered levels of consciousness were studied . of these , 23 patients were known diabetics , and 28 were not diabetic . the change in glucose level for the total study group ranged from a low of 37 mg / dl to a high of 370 mg / dl , with a mean of 166 + / - 77 mg / dl . the mean for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 177 + / - 80 mg / dl and 154 + / - 75 mg / dl . these results suggest that serum glucose levels cannot be quantitatively predicted after a single intravenous bolus of d-50 . 
nasogastric intubation : morbidity in an asymptomatic patient . an unusual case of a misdirected nasogastric tube is described . an elderly woman was brought to an emergency department following intentional drug overdose . initially unrecognized errant placement of a large-bore nasogastric tube resulted in tension pneumothorax , pneumonia , and subsequent death . pertinent medical literature is reviewed , clinical considerations for the elderly patient are discussed , and suggestions for proper nasogastric tube placement are offered . 
massive transfusion without major complications after trauma . a case of massive degloving injury of the trunk , with open pelvic fracture , and evisceration of abdominal contents from blunt trauma is presented . the most significant aspect of this case was the transfusion of 173 units of packed cells and 176 units of fresh frozen plasma in the first thirty hours . the patient ultimately recovered and returned to work . 
acute carbon monoxide poisoning during pregnancy . the course of a pregnant patient at term who was acutely exposed to carbon monoxide is described . a review of the fetal-maternal carboxyhemoglobin relationships and the differences in fetal oxyhemoglobin physiology are used to explain the recommendation that pregnant women with carbon monoxide poisoning should receive 100 % oxygen therapy for up to five times longer than is otherwise necessary . the role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is considered . 
intraosseous infusion of phenytoin . in the critically ill child , administration of fluids and medications via the intraosseous route often proves life-saving . the authors describe the case of a child with status epilepticus in whom phenytoin was administered via the intraosseous route , and seizure resolution and therapeutic serum levels were achieved . intraosseous drug administration should be reserved for the rare critically ill child in whom vascular access proves impossible . 
boerhaave 's syndrome : an elusive diagnosis . boerhaave 's syndrome represents a diagnostic dilemma for the emergency physician . the prognosis of this truly life-threatening emergency is darkened by any significant diagnostic delay . unfortunately , classic or expected symptoms and signs are frequently absent at presentation , a circumstance that leads to frequent misdiagnosis . two cases of boerhaave 's syndrome with " atypical " clinical presentations are reviewed and discussed . it is clear that boerhaave 's syndrome should always be suspected in the evaluation of any sudden chest , abdominal , or back pain associated with emesis . however , emphasis should be placed on the fact that this entity may occur without emesis . the chest radiograph is the most helpful diagnostic aid . undoubtedly , maintenance of a high degree of suspicion by the emergency physician for boerhaave 's syndrome will lead consistently to earlier diagnosis , and subsequent aggressive intervention should result in considerable reduction in rates of both morbidity and mortality .

intraosseous infusions : a usable technique . intraosseous infusions were widely used in pediatric patients during the 1930s and 1940s . recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration . however , these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle . spinal needles , standard metal intravenous ( iv ) needles , and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion . these needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg . the site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study . it was found that the 13-gauge kormed / jamshidi disposable bone marrow / aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion . an area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable , relatively flat , and easily penetrable location for needle placement . this method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients . intraosseous needle placement is a safe , rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation . by utilizing these techniques , a stable , usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients . 
intravenous hydrocarbon abuse . the case of a man who injected turpentine intravenously in an attempt to kill himself is reported . the patient developed immediate pulmonary edema and hypoxia , followed later by cellulitis at the site of injection . although only one death to date has been attributed to this form of chemical abuse , extensive local reactions , pulmonary involvement , central nervous system depression , and febrile reactions should be anticipated , and such patients should be admitted to the hospital . patients should be observed for local reactions and myonecrosis around the site of injection , especially as these occur 12-24 hours later . 
thallium poisoning in cocaine abusers . the users of illicit drugs is endangered by both unpredictable concentrations of the drugs and by unexpected adulterants that may be present . cocaine has been adulterated or admixed with numerous substances , among them local anesthetics , amphetamine , phencyclidine , and strychnine . we report three cases of thallium poisoning following nasal insufflation of a substance that was believed to have been cocaine . 
pulmonary edema induced by intravenous ethchlorvynol . the intravenous injection of ethchlorvynol is an uncommon cause of noncardiac pulmonary edema . two cases of intravenous ethchlorvynol-induced pulmonary edema are presented . the patients fell asleep after injecting the liquid contents of placydil capsules ( ethchlorvynol ) and awoke several hours later with severe dyspnea . arterial blood gases demonstrated marked hypoxia . chest radiographs revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar densities . the patients ' symptoms and radiographic findings resolved after several days of supportive care . changes in the lung caused by ethchlorvynol may be the result of direct effect of the drug on the lung . 
atropine in the treatment of baclofen overdose . a patient suffering baclofen overdose successfully treated with atropine is reported . three hours after admission for ingestion of at least 300 mg baclofen as a single dose , the patient became comatose and subsequently bradycardic , hypotensive , and hypothermic . a prompt increase in heart rate and blood pressure followed administration of 1 mg of atropine sulfate . atropine appears to be useful in treating cases of baclofen overdose complicated by bradycardia and hypotension . 
ingestion of compound w , an unusual caustic . a case of an unusual caustic ingestion involving compound w , an over the counter wart remover is presented . chemical burns of the tongue , pharynx and larynx developed . the active ingredient in this preparation : salicylic acid in a flexible collodion vehicle produces caustic injury through a keratolytic action , which may be enhanced by the presence of collodion .

in vivo evaluation of a permanently implantable thermal ventricular assist system . the system 7 pump / actuator / engine combination has demonstrated biologic compatibility and physiologic effectiveness and responsiveness in five tvas in vivo studies . the recent 75-day implant supports the feasibility of extended reliability of the system components . postoperative system maintenance was necessary only because of the nonhermetic design of system 7. however , the ability to pump 11 l / min at 120 beats / min , synchronize at beat rates of 144 beats / min , and pump against mean arterial pressures of more than 150 mmhg while maintaining hematologic and biochemical values within physiologic range sets a very optimistic stage for system 8 hardware . a system 8 concept is shown in figure 14. the system 8 hardware will include a thermal salt package capable of providing completely untethered circulatory support for a nominal 8-h period . recharge will be accomplished with a transcutaneous transformer in 1 h . thermal management problems become minimal , with an average energy input of 15.8 w ( peak of 24.9 w ) . the human preclinical testing of system 8 will start in 1988.

removal of aluminum from chronic dialysis patients by administration of desferrioxamine and dialysis . in order to perform quantitative in vitro and clinical studies on the removal of al by the combined therapy of dfo administration and hd , an hplc system for measuring dfo was established and a leaky membrane with enhanced permeability to middle molecular substances was developed . the dfo infusion caused rises in plasma al levels ( regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated al ) in patients undergoing hd . plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain . examination of al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma al content passed through hd membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms / l , and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of al as well as dfo than the conventional one . although a 1 : 1 complex between dfo and al in an aqueous solution was confirmed , the formation of al-rich complexes in vivo was suggested . it is concluded that al-dfo complex formed in vivo can be effectively removed across the leaky membrane .

quantitation of platelet and fibrinogen-fibrin deposition on components of tissue valves ( ionescu-shiley ) in calves . with 111in-labeled platelets and 125i-labeled bovine fibrinogen , regional mapping of platelet and fibrinogen deposition on leaflets and sewing rings was obtained . ten holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves ( islm ) and were killed 1 , 14 , and 30 days after implantation . twenty-four hours before the calves were killed , 350 to 450 microci of 111in-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microci of 125i-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously . the components of the tissue valves , i.e. , three leaflets and sewing rings , were separated . each leaflet was cut into four sections : free edge , central zone , flexion zone , and attachment zone . from the radioactivity in blood , leaflet zones , sewing rings , area of leaflet zones , platelet count , and fibrinogen level in blood , the mean regional density of adherent platelets , fibrinogen-fibrin , and fibrinogen / platelet were calculated . the density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation . the number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones , suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve .

bilirubin removal from a jaundiced premature infant by resin hemoperfusion . to summarize the results : bilirubin removal by hemoperfusion was successfully performed for the first time on a premature infant . the hemoperfusion caused no adverse effects on the clinical state of the infant . the bilirubin removed in 90 min--13 mg--indicates the existence of a large extravascular pool . hemoperfusion is suggested for bilirubin removal from newborn babies , reducing the need for blood exchange with bank blood . 
development of a regenerated cellulose non-complement activating membrane for hemodialysis . we have developed a new cellulose membrane in which the active hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the original cellulose fibers are masked with cationic synthetic polymers . the membrane was shown by in vitro and clinical tests to affect the activation of the complement system very little , and it retains the high dialysis efficiency , good tolerance to steam autoclave sterilization , and economical production cost characteristics of the original cellulose membrane . it thus appears that the new cellulose provides the optimum combination of qualities needed in a hemodialysis membrane .

pharmacokinetics of atracurium in anaesthetized infants and children . the pharmacokinetics of atracurium were studied in infants and children anaesthetized with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen . there were no significant differences in volume of distribution ( area ) ( 139 v . 152 ml kg-1 ) , clearance ( 5.1 v . 5.3 ml kg-1 min-1 ) , t1 / 2 alpha ( 2.1 v . 2.0 min ) , or t1 / 2 beta ( 19.1 v . 20.3 min ) between children with normal hepatic and renal function and those with moderately impaired hepatic function presenting for hepatic transplantation . there were significant differences in volume of distribution ( area ) ( 176 v . 139 ml kg-1 ) and in clearance of atracurium ( 9.1 v . 5.1 ml kg-1 min-1 ) between infants and children with normal excretory function . in infants the clearance of atracurium in ml m-2 min-1 ( 153 v . 133 ) tended to be greater and the t1 / 2 alpha and t1 / 2 beta tended to be shorter ( 1.0 v . 2.0 and 13.6 v . 19.1 ) than in children with normal excretory function ; however , these trends did not reach statistical significance . plasma laudanosine concentration was around 100 ng ml-1 greater in patients with liver disease than in normal children from 15-45 min following a bolus of atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 . 
use of atracurium during major abdominal surgery in infants with hepatic dysfunction from biliary atresia . the use of atracurium during major abdominal surgery was assessed in 20 infants with hepatic dysfunction caused by biliary atresia . an initial dose of 0.6 mg kg-1 provided excellent intubating conditions in all patients . subsequent neuromuscular blockade was monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator and incremental doses of atracurium were given on reappearance of a single twitch . neuromuscular conduction was allowed to return at the end of surgery and by careful timing of increments it was necessary to antagonize the neuromuscular blockade in only two patients . 
prospective study of liver function in children following multiple halothane anaesthetics at short intervals . in the 4 years january 1981 to december 1984 , 186 children received 1362 halothane anaesthetics . twenty-five patients were anaesthetized with halothane at least 10 times in a year . no patient developed postoperative jaundice . sixty-nine children were exposed to two halothane anaesthetics within 28 days on 149 occasions and serial estimations of serum liver enzyme concentrations were obtained . minor increases in the concentrations of serum ast and alt were recorded in 10.6 % and 4.7 % of patient entries , respectively . postoperative ggt and sap concentrations were increased in 2.7 % of patient entries . patients in whom enzyme values were increased before the first anaesthetic were no more likely than other subjects to develop further changes . 
histamine release during the administration of atracurium or vecuronium in children . the histamine releasing potential of equivalent bolus doses of atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1 or vecuronium 0.12 mg kg-1 was evaluated in 20 children anaesthetized with halothane . blood samples were obtained before , and at 2 and 5 min after the administration of the neuromuscular blocker . the twitch response to 0.15 hz was also evaluated . none of the 10 patients receiving vecuronium had a significant increase in plasma histamine concentration . in two of the 10 children receiving atracurium , the plasma histamine concentration increased markedly , but without any apparent clinical manifestations . recovery of neuromuscular function ( to 95 % twitch height ) after vecuronium 0.12 mg kg-1 was faster than after atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1 ( p less than 0.02 ) . 
ventilation , ventilatory carbon dioxide and hormonal response during halothane anaesthesia and surgery in children after midazolam premedication . in 14 intubated , spontaneously breathing children with body weight ( bw ) ranging from 8.3 to 25.6 kg , the influence of midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 i.m. ( group m0.1 , n = 7 ) and 0.2 mg kg-1 i.m. ( group m0.2 , n = 7 ) as premedication , on sedation , ventilation , ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and hormonal stress response was studied in connection with minor surgical procedures during halothane anaesthesia . the concentrations of catecholamines , acth and cortisol were measured immediately after induction , during undisturbed anaesthesia , during surgery and 15 min after the end of the surgical procedure . sedation was better and plasma catecholamine concentrations during undisturbed anaesthesia were less in children receiving the larger dose of midazolam . during surgery and in recovery there were no differences in hormone concentrations . in recovery , the concentrations of all hormones were significantly greater compared with during undisturbed anaesthesia . during surgery , ve and respiratory rate were somewhat lower in group m0.2 while e ' co2 was similar . a dose dependent depression of the response to carbon dioxide was found . however , clinically , the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide after surgery was considered to be adequate in both groups . 
evoked electromyographic and mechanical responses of the adductor pollicis compared during the onset of neuromuscular blockade by atracurium or alcuronium , and during antagonism by neostigmine . the effects of atracurium and alcuronium on the evoked mechanical and electromyographic responses of the adductor pollicis were investigated in 30 adult patients . the ulnar nerve was stimulated with trains of four supramaximal pulses of 0.2 ms duration and a frequency of 2 hz at intervals of 20 s . the mechanical response was measured using a strain gauge force transducer and the evoked compound action potential ( ecap ) was recorded simultaneously using a medelec ms91 electromyography system . depression of the electromyographic and mechanical responses , caused by atracurium , was similar during onset and antagonism of blockade . during onset of blockade by alcuronium , the mechanical response was depressed to a significantly greater extent compared with the ecap . this difference was not observed during antagonism with neostigmine . the rates of onset of atracurium and alcuronium were generally similar , but the rate of onset of mechanical fade was greater in the alcuronium group . there was no significant quantitative difference between the rates of antagonism of alcuronium and atracurium when assessed by the mechanical first response ratio . electromyographic first response and electromyographic and mechanical train-of-four ratios recovered more rapidly in the atracurium group . these findings suggest that the differences between mechanical and electromyographic measurements of neuromuscular blockade are drug-specific and are more pronounced during the onset of blockade than during its antagonism by neostigmine . 
antagonism of profound neuromuscular blockade induced by vecuronium or atracurium . comparison of neostigmine with edrophonium . the effectiveness of neostigmine 0.07 mg kg-1 and edrophonium 0.8 mg kg-1 as antagonists of profound neuromuscular blockade induced by vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 or atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 was studied in 59 healthy patients . the antagonists were administered 5 min after total ablation of the twitch response and the end-point of recovery was a train-of-four ratio of 70 % . in 30 patients given vecuronium the mean time to reach this point ( duration tof70 ) was 66.7 min in the control group ( no antagonist ) , 43.5 min in the group given neostigmine and 59.8 min in the group given edrophonium . the duration tof70 was shorter in the neostigmine group than in the control ( p less than 0.01 ) and edrophonium ( p less than 0.01 ) groups . the duration tof70 did not differ from control in the edrophonium group . in 29 patients given atracurium , the durations tof70 were 66.4 , 44.1 and 54.9 min in the control , neostigmine and edrophonium groups , respectively . the durations tof70 in the neostigmine ( p less than 0.01 ) and edrophonium ( p less than 0.01 ) , groups were shorter than control . the duration tof70 of the neostigmine group was shorter than in the edrophonium group ( p less than 0.01 ) . these results show that profound neuromuscular blockade cannot be rapidly antagonized by either of these two agents , but if reversal is required under these circumstances , neostigmine would be the more effective drug . 
antagonism of atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade by neostigmine or edrophonium . antagonism of atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade by neostigmine or edrophonium has been studied using the tetanic ( 50 hz ) and train-of-four ( 2 hz ) or single twitch responses of the adductor pollicis muscle in 22 anaesthetized patients . a further nine patients not given an anticholinesterase acted as a control group . in two groups ( six patients for each anticholinesterase ) in whom antagonism was attempted at 95-98 % blockade of the tetanic response , recovery of the tetanic response after two or three doses of edrophonium 0.75 mg kg-1 i.v. was not statistically different from that in the control group ; recovery after two doses of neostigmine 2.5 mg i.v. was significantly faster ( p less than 0.001 ) . recovery of the single twitch response after antagonism with edrophonium , although longer than that with neostigmine ( p less than 0.01 ) , was significantly shorter than in the control group ( p less than 0.05 ) . when edrophonium is given at the commencement of recovery , the initial rapid antagonism of tetanic block is not sustained , whereas antagonism by neostigmine is more persistent and the recovery phase is significantly shortened . in a further two groups of patients ( n = 5 ) given atracurium 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v. , antagonism was not attempted until the peak height of the tetanic contraction had reached approximately 50 % of the control value .

reappearance of the train-of-four after neuromuscular blockade induced with tubocurarine , vecuronium or atracurium . the characteristics of train-of-four recovery after atracurium or vecuronium were studied , under enflurane anaesthesia , and compared with those associated with tubocurarine-induced blockade . ten patients each received vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 , atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 or tubocurarine 0.5 mg kg-1 . neuromuscular blockade was calculated as the percent depression of the first twitch , and was determined at the time of reappearance of the second , third and fourth twitches of the train-of-four . the pattern during recovery from blockade induced by the three neuromuscular blocking agents was similar , with t2 , t3 and t4 reappearing at approximately 93 % , 89 % and 86 % residual blockade , respectively . these results are different from those previously reported by lee ( 1975 ) indicating that , under enflurane anaesthesia , the train-of-four count may give an incorrect estimate of the degree of neuromuscular blockade . 
comparison of visual and measured train-of-four recovery after vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade using two anaesthetic techniques . this study evaluated train-of-four recovery after the administration of vecuronium , comparing measured with visually observed responses . responses to supramaximal stimuli of the ulnar nerves were measured by a force transducer , and compared with visually observed movements of the contralateral thumb . for the 10 patients anaesthetized with nitrous oxide and enflurane , the second , third and fourth twitches visually reappeared at 84 ( + / - 10 ) % , 76 ( + / - 11 ) % , and 70 ( + / - 12 ) % measured blockade , respectively . for the other 10 patients , anaesthetized with a narcotic-barbiturate technique , the second , third and fourth twitches reappeared at 81 ( + / - 8 ) % , 68 ( + / - 9 ) % , and 59 ( + / - 11 ) % . these results were not different for the two anaesthetic techniques . 
pharmacokinetics of galanthamine ( a long-acting anticholinesterase drug ) in anaesthetized patients . the pharmacokinetics of the long-acting anticholinesterase drug , galanthamine , were investigated in eight patients . after i.v. injection of 0.3 mg kg-1 , the decrease in the serum concentration of galanthamine followed a biexponential curve . the serum concentration decreased rapidly from 543 + / - 47 ng ml-1 to 128 + / - 14 ng ml-1 between 2 and 30 min with a t1 / 2 alpha of 6.42 + / - 2.15 min , and then declined more slowly with a t1 / 2 beta of 264 + / - 28 min . total serum clearance of galanthamine amounted to 5.37 + / - 0.87 ml min-1 kg-1 , and the renal clearance was 1.36 + / - 0.10 ml min-1 kg-1 . the cumulative urinary excretion of galanthamine between 0 and 48 h after injection amounted to 28.0 + / - 5.4 % of the administered dose . the biliary excretion of galanthamine during 24 h amounted to 0.2 + / - 0.1 % of the dose . there was no evidence of glucuronide or sulphate conjugation of galanthamine . 
a sheep preparation for studying interactions between blood flow and drug disposition . vi : effects of general or subarachnoid anaesthesia on blood flow and chlormethiazole disposition . blood flow through and chlormethiazole extraction ratios across lungs , liver , kidneys and gut were measured in awake unrestrained sheep ( controls ) and with the same animals anaesthetized with 1.5 % halothane or whilst undergoing high thoracic subarachnoid blockade with amethocaine . in the control-drug studies , chlormethiazole infused to sub-sedative blood concentrations produced no significant changes in haemodynamics or in the kinetics of iodohippurate ( renal and hepatic blood flows ) . chlormethiazole was eliminated predominantly by the liver ( mean extraction ratio and clearance , respectively , 0.90 and 1.3 litre min-1 ) and lungs ( 0.15 ; 0.6 litre min-1 ) . renal clearance was absent or negligible ( greater than 0.1 litre min-1 ) . because of pulmonary clearance , mean total body clearance was derived from analysis of pulmonary arterial concentrations . under general anaesthesia , there were significant reductions in mean cardiac output , hepatic and renal blood flow ( to 54 % , 63 % and 43 % of control ) ; chlormethiazole mean hepatic extraction ratios and clearance were reduced , respectively , to 82 % and 56 % of control , and its pulmonary and renal clearances were abolished . with subarachnoid anaesthesia there were no significant changes in haemodynamics or in chlormethiazole extraction ratios or clearances . 
placement of double-lumen endobronchial tubes . correlation between clinical impressions and bronchoscopic findings . double-lumen endobronchial tubes were placed " blindly " in 23 patients undergoing thoracotomy . clinical criteria suggested satisfactory positioning in all cases ; however , subsequent fibreoptic bronchoscopy revealed malposition in 48 % . bronchoscopic findings included the inability to view the bronchial cuff , narrowing of the bronchial lumen of the tube at the level of the cuff and herniation of the cuff over the carina . the potential hazards associated with these findings are discussed .

an open study of vitamin d3 treatment in psoriasis vulgaris . active forms of vitamin d3 , 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin d3 and 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 , were administered in an open-design study to 40 patients with psoriasis vulgaris in three ways : to 17 patients 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin d3 was given orally at a dose of 1.0 micrograms / day for 6 months , to four patients 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 was given orally at a dose of 0.5 microgram / day for 6 months , and 19 patients were given 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 applied topically at concentration of 0.5 microgram / g of base for 8 weeks . improvement was observed at the end of the individual study periods in 13 ( 76 % ) patients in group 1 with a mean period of treatment ( + / - sd ) of 2.7 + / - 0.6 months , in one patient in group 2 at 3 months after the start of treatment , and in 16 ( 84 % ) patients in group 3 when the chemical was applied for 3.3 + / - 1.2 weeks . no side-effects were observed in any of these trials . these data suggest that psoriasis may respond to active metabolites of vitamin d3 and that abnormalities in vitamin d metabolism or in responsiveness of the skin cells to active metabolites of vitamin d may be involved in the pathogenesis of this skin disease . 
successful treatment of psoriasis with topical application of active vitamin d3 analogue , 1 alpha , 24-dihydroxycholecalciferol . we treated 11 psoriatic patients with topical 1 alpha , 24-dihydroxycholecalciferol , a new synthetic analogue of active vitamin d3 . in 10 of 15 tests the lesions cleared completely within 1-4 weeks , although some relapses occurred shortly after cessation of treatment . there were no side-effects . we suggest that 1 alpha , 24 ( oh ) 2d3 merits further investigation as a potentially useful topical therapy for psoriasis . 
circulating antibodies and antigenic cross-reactivity in hendersonula toruloidea and scytalidium hyalinum infections . twelve ( 34 % ) of thirty-five patients with an active infection on the palms or soles caused by hendersonula toruloidea or scytalidium hyalinum were found to have circulating antibodies to these organisms by counter immunoelectrophoresis or immunodiffusion , compared with 9 % of uninfected controls . in every instance there was cross-reactivity between the positive patients ' sera and the heterologous non-dermatophyte antigen . using crossed and intermediate gel immunoelectrophoresis it was found that cytoplasmic extracts of h . toruloidea and s . hyalinum showed 34 and 41 precipitin peaks respectively , most of which were shared by both organisms . no cross-reactions were observed between the non-dermatophyte cytoplasmic extracts and hyperimmune animal antisera raised to trichophyton rubrum , trichophyton interdigitale , aspergillus fumigatus or candida albicans . exoantigens prepared from the two non-dermatophytes showed similar cross-reactivity between the two species . it appears that h . toruloidea and s . hyalinum are very similar in antigenic structure , a finding which lends support to the view that they may be closely related . they are also antigenically distinct from other pathogenic fungi which commonly infect skin , a fact which may be useful in their cultural identification as well as their recognition in tissue specimens . 
a quantitative study of the effect of topical indomethacin on cutaneous erythema induced by uvb and uvc radiation . the effect of indomethacin gel on uvb and uvc erythema was assessed objectively using a reflectance instrument . when indomethacin was applied immediately after irradiation , uvr ( ultraviolet radiation ) dose-dependent suppression of erythema was demonstrated for both wavelengths until 36 h after irradiation when both indomethacin and control gel base-treated sites were equally erythematous . suppression of erythema also occurred when application of indomethacin was delayed until 24 h after irradiation , showing that for both wavelengths prostaglandin synthesis remains increased throughout this period . the degree of suppression at any time , however , was no greater than that achieved by a single application immediately after irradiation , indicating that the eventual equal erythema of indomethacin and gel base-treated sites was not due to tachyphylaxis or inadequate dosage . construction of dose-response curves for the indomethacin-responsive and indomethacin-unresponsive components of erythema shows that in human skin the difference in erythemal response to uvb and uvc radiation is not due to the formation of different mediators at these wavelengths . 
behavioural treatment of scratching in patients with atopic dermatitis . a behavioural method of habit reversal , in combination with a hydrocortisone cream , was compared with the use of cream alone in the treatment of 17 patients with atopic dermatitis . the patients were assigned randomly to two groups , one of which received the combination treatment and the other regular ointment treatment . the patients ' skin status was assessed before and after treatment , and the patients recorded their scratching during the study . both groups improved , but the group which received habit-reversal therapy improved significantly more . a strong correlation was found between reduction in scratching and improvement in skin status . 
effect of percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone on adrenocortical responsiveness in infants with severe skin disease . percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone was studied in 18 children ( aged from 6 weeks to 14 1 / 2 years ) with atopic or seborrhoeic dermatitis , by measuring their serum cortisol before and after application of 1 % hydrocortisone cream . endogenous secretion of cortisol was suppressed with dexamethasone . a 24 h absorption test was performed on nine children . in six , percutaneous absorption was detected . the highest serum cortisol level was reached within the first 6 h . a 4 h absorption test was developed on the basis of the 24 h test . this short absorption test was performed on nine children , and in eight of them absorption of hydrocortisone was detected . the rise of serum cortisol ranged from 98 to 2669 nmol / l . the 2 h acth test was performed to evaluate the effect of previous treatment with topical glucocorticoids . suppressed adrenocortical function was found in five of 13 children , and was associated significantly with high post-application serum cortisol levels . this occurred more often in infants with a severe skin disorder than in older children or in those with mild or moderate skin disease . 
challenge reactions in atopic dermatitis after percutaneous entry of mite antigen . we succeeded in reproducing an eczematous lesion on the apparently normal skin of a patient with atopic dermatitis by scratching and continuous application of an ointment containing ferritin-labelled mite antigen . percutaneous entry of mite antigen was demonstrated in skin biopsies by fe-staining . scratched skin first showed an urticarial reaction typical of type i allergy which later changed into an eczematous reaction typical of type iv allergy . this change was also shown histologically .

the effects of inflammatory bowel disease on pregnancy : a case-controlled retrospective analysis . retrospective analysis of 82 pregnancies in women with either ulcerative colitis or crohn 's disease suggested that , in general , neither disease had a major effect on pregnancy outcome . the birth-weights of babies born to women with inflammatory bowel disease were marginally lower than those born to women in a control group matched for age and parity , but the difference was statistically significant only in women with crohn 's disease . in both disease groups there was a higher frequency of low haemoglobin levels in pregnancy than in the matched control groups . there were no statistically significant effects of ulcerative colitis or crohn 's disease on duration of pregnancy , mode of delivery or raised blood pressure and / or proteinuria . in the absence of a relapse , a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should not influence obstetric management . 
fetal and maternal effects of forceps and vacuum extraction . 
alpha interferon in human pregnancy . the concentration of interferon-alpha was measured by a specific two-site immunoradiometric assay in a variety of fluids and tissues collected during human pregnancy . maternal blood and blood and tissues from non-pregnant adults contained little or no interferon-alpha . fetal blood , fetal organs , placenta , membranes , amniotic fluid and decidua all contained significant and roughly equivalent amounts ranging from 1.1 to 10 u / ml ( or per g of tissue ) . these findings demonstrate that the fetus and its immediate surroundings are permeated with interferon . it is suggested that this may play a role in regulation of the maternal-fetal graft relation . 
enhanced phagocytosis of mononuclear phagocytes in pregnancy . the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes for staphylococcus epidermis of healthy non-pregnant and pregnant women throughout pregnancy was examined in relation to gestational age . the study included 30 healthy non-pregnant women and 90 healthy pregnant women equally distributed across the three trimesters . two variables were investigated : the number of mononuclear cells in phagocytosis and the average number of bacteria per monocyte in phagocytosis . as pregnancy progressed a gradual and significant increase was found in the number of monocytes in phagocytosis and a significantly higher proportion of macrophages with six or more bacteria per phagocyte .

vergence amplitudes with random-dot stereograms . random-dot stereograms were found to be capable of producing fusional vergence amplitudes in the absence of monocular contours . these vergence amplitudes are not an artefact of monocular contours provided by the target borders or test instrument and are comparable in range to vergence amplitudes measured clinically with second degree fusion targets in an amblyoscope . we conclude that diplopia of monocularly recognisable contours is not necessary for producing fusional vergence amplitudes . 
posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation--a new forceps to simplify capsular bag fixation . the case for capsular bag fixation of the sinsky-kratz type of posterior chamber intraocular implant lens is presented , and the various methods in use to position implant lenses are outlined . the new forceps are described and the rationale for their adoption and use is given in an illustrated , step-by-step fashion . their additional use in anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation is mentioned . there is a brief summary of the author 's experience with this instrument . 
regression of labrador keratopathy following cataract extraction . labrador keratopathy ( lk ) is an acquired corneal degeneration thought to be caused by chronic exposure to solar irradiation . reports so far suggest that it is a progressive or at least a stationary condition . there are no detailed reports on recommended therapy . a prospective clinical study was conducted to show regression of lk following extracapsular cataract extraction . seventeen black patients ( 26 eyes ) with lk and mature cataracts underwent extracapsular cataract extraction . the severity of the lk was recorded photographically pre- and postoperatively . the follow-up ranged from 6 to fifteen months . twenty-four eyes ( 92 % ) showed regression of the lk . the reduction in exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of aphakic photophobia could be one of the factors which have led to the regression of the lk . 
sussex eye hospital sports injuries . to assess the prevalence of sports eye injuries in our area a register was kept over the 18 months from october 1982 to march 1984. squash , association football , badminton , and tennis were the main offenders . the severest injury was from a golf ball , involving a fractured zygoma . there was one retinal dialysis , and one lens dislocation requiring extraction . spectacles were broken in six cases and a contact lens in one . glass fragments needed operative removal in one case , but there were no penetrating injuries . the value of eye protection , not worn by any of our patients , is emphasised . 
inferences from beading of a retinal vein draining a choroidal melanoma . beading of a retinal vein draining a choroidal melanoma is reported , showing that the endothelial proliferation producing the beading is a response to some blood borne factor ( s ) traversing the vein and that retinal capillary non-perfusion adjacent to the beaded vein is not a necessary part of the process . 
photographic recording of slit-lamp appearances of the ocular fundus . the four methods of illumination in the use of slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment , described first by vogt , are equally useful in the posterior part of the eye . examination of the ocular fundus is more difficult . in particular , photography of the central and peripheral parts of the fundus demands additional technical arrangements if all the appearances of biomicroscopy are to be recorded . 
sunglasses--an ocular hazard ? a suggestion that protective eye gear can pose a threat either to the crystalline lens or to the retina is examined from an epidemiological point of view . it is concluded that it may accentuate a pre-existing high-risk hazard but has little significance for low-risk hazards . 
retinal cotton-wool spots : an early finding in diabetic retinopathy ? five insulin dependent diabetic patients are reported on who had a few small retinal cotton-wool spots or ' soft exudates ' either totally isolated or associated with fewer than 10 microaneurysms . these observations suggest that cotton-wool spots may be an early finding in diabetic retinopathy . significant biological abnormalities in these patients were high levels of glycosylated haemoglobin and mild increases in thrombin generation , indicating slight activation of the coagulation system . the possible significance of these clinical and biological findings is discussed . 
the presumed neurotoxic effects of catha edulis--an exotic plant now available in the united kingdom . bilateral optic atrophy is reported in two patients who , although they were long-standing users of the leaves of catha edulis , had chewed larger quantities than usual . since the leaves of this plant are used widely throughout its native area as the source of a mildly stimulant narcotic , the effect in these cases may be an idiosyncratic reaction to an unusually large dose . 
histopathology of mitochondrial cytopathy and the laurence-moon-biedl syndrome . clinical and histopathological studies of two patients with distinctly different inherited juvenile retinal dystrophies indicate that the ocular defect in mitochondrial cytopathy involves the underlying pigment epithelium , whereas in the laurence-moon-biedl syndrome the photoreceptor cells are primarily affected . 
lysis of human fibroblast colony-forming cells and endothelial cells by monoclonal antibody ( 6-19 ) and complement . the murine igg2a monoclonal antibody 6-19 binds to a wide variety of nonhematopoietic cells including human marrow-derived stromal cells but does not bind to marrow or peripheral blood cells . we studied the effects of this antibody and rabbit complement on marrow cells . fibroblast colonies were eliminated from light density marrow cells by a single incubation with monoclonal antibody 6-19 and complement . the growth and composition of granulocytic and erythroid colonies were unaffected . specific complement mediated cytotoxicity of the antibody was confirmed on passaged human fibroblasts derived from marrow ( more than 99.6 % of fibroblasts are killed by a single treatment ) . similar results were obtained with human umbilical cord endothelial cells . in addition , such treatment abolished the initiation of dexter culture stroma . incubation of bone marrow cell suspensions with this antibody and complement will allow the study of stroma-free marrow cells in long-term liquid cultures . 
sl / sld mouse bone marrow stroma in vitro contains an active radiation-sensitive inhibitor of normal hemopoiesis . sl / sld mice have a defective hemopoietic microenvironment . it has been assumed , based upon previous studies , that the primary abnormality in these mice is simply lack of a necessary supportive or inductive material within the hemopoietic stroma . we used in vitro long-term bone marrow cultures to characterize further the nature of the hemopoietic microenvironmental defect in sl / sld mice . sl / sld mouse bone marrow cells consistently produced less than 10 % of the total hemopoietic cells and multipotent and unipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells produced in cultures of marrow from normal , congenic + / + mice . if fresh sl / sld and + / + marrow cells were mixed prior to establishing long-term marrow cultures , there was a direct correlation between number of sl / sld cells added and degree of inhibition of + / + hemopoiesis . a pre-established , confluent sl / sld adherent stromal layer inhibited hemopoiesis by fresh + / + marrow cells by nearly 70 % , as compared with dishes with irradiated + / + or no stroma . this inhibitory effect was abrogated by irradiation of the sl / sld stroma prior to addition of the fresh + / + marrow cells . similarly , unirradiated , but not 9 to 200 gy irradiated sl / sld stroma inhibited proliferation of the factor-dependent fdc-p1 hemopoietic progenitor cell line . thus , the sl / sld hemopoietic microenvironment actively inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro , and this inhibition can be at least partially eliminated by irradiation of the sl / sld stroma . 
expression of fibrinogen receptors during activation and subsequent desensitization of human platelets by epinephrine . epinephrine causes platelet aggregation and secretion by interacting with alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on the platelet surface . platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein iib-iiia complex . although the iib-iiia complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets , the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation . the current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets . the ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions : acute stimulation ( less than 1 min ) and prolonged stimulation ( 50 to 90 min ) , the latter of which is associated with a reduction or " desensitization " of the platelet aggregation response . expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125i-fibrinogen as well as with 125i-pac-1 ( pac-1 ) , a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein iib-iiia complex only after platelets are activated . epinephrine caused an immediate increase in pac-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free ca ( kca = 30 mumol / l ) . by itself , 1 mmol / l mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine . however , it did decrease the ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude . prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70 % decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred . despite their decreased aggregation response , desensitized platelets bound pac-1 and fibrinogen normally , indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression . although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin , it was partially prevented when extracellular ca was chelated by edta during the long incubation with epinephrine . these studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine , extracellular ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen . furthermore . ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine . 
morphological abnormalities in the lymphocytes of patients with the wiskott-aldrich syndrome . lymphocytes from 18 patients with the wiskott-aldrich syndrome ( was ) were examined by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) . most peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals are covered with slender microvillus projections , but a large proportion of lymphocytes from was patients were found to be relatively devoid of microvilli . a lymphocyte morphology scoring system was developed to quantify the density of microvilli : grade 4 classified those lymphocytes with greater than 75 % of the surface covered with microvilli with progressive decrements to grade 1 , which were those without microvilli . the mean lymphocyte morphology score of eight normal individuals was 3.62 + / - .22 . the mean lymphocyte score of was patients was substantially lower ( 2.89 + / - .27 , p less than .001 ) . in addition , was lymphocytes often were qualitatively abnormal , with short , blunted microvilli . these morphological criteria were used to diagnose was from the cord blood lymphocytes of one " at-risk " patient . thus , was is the first primary immunodeficiency in which morphological abnormalities have been identified that can aid in diagnosis . 
quantitative relationship between heinz body formation and red blood cell deformability . the ultimate cause of destruction of red blood cells ( rbcs ) after oxidative damage with heinz body formation is not well understood . we correlated the changes in rbc morphology and membrane protein composition after oxidant treatment with the alterations in deformability of whole cells and cell membranes . the incubation of rbcs with phenylhydrazine concentrations of 0.3 to 100 mg / dl at 37 degrees c for one hour led to a dose-dependent formation of heinz bodies , ranging from isolated heinz bodies at 1 mg / dl to a confluent coating of the inner membrane surface at 100 mg / dl phenylhydrazine . sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a large quantity of hemoglobin bound to the ghost membrane of treated rbcs . electrophoresis with and without dithiothreitol indicated that disulfide bridges are abundant between hemoglobin molecules and are also present among membrane proteins but are not the major bond between hemoglobin and membrane . changes of spectrin , ankyrin , band 3 , and band 6 and the appearance of a 260 , 000-dalton complex were also observed . with phenylhydrazine concentrations below 30 mg / dl , even in the presence of multiple heinz bodies , the rbc deformability measured by filtration through 2.6- , 4.5- , and 6.8-microns pores and the membrane deformability determined by a filter aspiration technique were not altered . with 100 mg / dl phenylhydrazine , when the entire membrane was coated with heinz bodies , rbc filterability and membrane deformability were drastically reduced . these results indicate that oxidative damage of rbcs with discrete heinz body formation causes focal membrane rigidification but does not affect the global cellular deformability until the heinz bodies nearly cover the entire cell endoface . 
beta zero-thalassemia in association with a gamma-globin gene quadruplication . we have studied the hematology , hemoglobin composition , and globin gene arrangements in one young turkish boy with a beta zero-thalassemia homozygosity and in 11 of his relatives . evidence is presented that the chromosome with the beta zero-thalassemia determinant carries a gamma-globin gene quadruplication , perhaps in a -g gamma-g gamma-g gamma-a gamma-gene arrangement . the eight gamma-globin genes in this patient produced g gamma and a gamma chains in a 95 to 5 ratio , and nearly 99 % of the patient 's hemoglobin was of the fetal type . the clinical condition resembled that of a thalassemia intermedia . hbf levels in eight beta-thalassemia heterozygotes varied between 0.5 and 4.2 % and the percentages of g gamma in this hbf averaged at 87 % or 95 % ; this level is to some extent related to the haplotype of the normal chromosome . all subjects carried four alpha-globin genes ; a new bglii polymorphism was observed within the psi alpha-globin gene . 
hyposialylation of differentiation-inducer-resistant hl-60 cells . the total sialic acid concent of retinoic acid ( ra ) -resistant or 6-thioguanine ( 6tg ) -resistant hl-60 cells was more than tenfold lower and of dimethylsulfoxide ( dmso ) -resistant hl-60 cells was approximately twofold lower than that of parental , wild-type ( wt ) hl-60 cells . neuraminidase-inaccessible , ie residual cell-associated sialic acid after neuraminidase treatment , was four- to twelvefold lower in the three differentiation-inducer-resistant sublines than in the parent line . neuraminidase treatment of 125i-labeled surface membrane glycoproteins ( smgs ) from wt hl-60 cells converted the two-dimensional gel electrophoretic pattern to one having features in common with ra- and 6tg-resistant cells . however , neuraminidase treatment did not alter the sensitivity of wt hl-60 cells to differentiation induction by ra , hypoxanthine ( purine base ) , or dmso . these results indicate that differences in peripheral , neuraminidase-accessible sialic acids are important determinants of the gel electrophoretic mobility of the smgs of the hl-60 line and sublines but are not likely related to the differentiation-resistance mechanism . further studies are required to determine if hyposialylation of cryptic , neuraminidase-inaccessible sites has functional significance . 
in vitro tumor cell cytolysis mediated by peptide defensins of human and rabbit granulocytes . we examined the activity of defensins , cysteine-rich cationic peptides that are abundant in the cytoplasmic granules of human and rabbit granulocytes , against various tumor targets . the three human defensins , hnp-1 , hnp-2 , and hnp-3 , lysed human and murine targets in chromium release and dye exclusion assays . defensin-mediated tumor cell lysis was concentration-dependent , inhibited by serum , and dependent on temperature-sensitive events . lysis was first detected by three hours of incubation and it reached a plateau between eight and 14 hours . in vitro exposure of murine teratocarcinoma cells to hnp 1-3 abrogated their oncogenicity in vivo . nonmalignant target cells were also susceptible to defensin-mediated lysis . four rabbit granulocyte defensins exerted marked ( np-1 , np-2 ) or moderate ( np-3a , np-3b ) cytotoxic activity , whereas defensin np-5 was not cytotoxic . when tumor cells were incubated with human defensins in combination with hydrogen peroxide , synergistic cytotoxicity was detected . as defensins are released from granulocytes by various stimuli , their release could contribute to extracellular cytotoxicity which is independent of reactive oxygen intermediates .

recent trends in rheumatoid arthritis . 
peptic ulcer in rheumatoid arthritis--intrinsic or related to drug therapy ? the reported incidence of peptic ulcer disease ( pud ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is higher than that of the general population . unusual susceptibility to pud in ra , independent of therapy , has been suggested . to compare ra patients with others who had similar drug exposure but no known predisposition to pud , 120 patients hospitalized for treatment of severe arthritis ( 65 with ra , 55 with osteoarthritis ) were assessed by questionnaire for pud history , drug history and other relevant variables . the relationship of pud to sex distribution , smoking , alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns . we found high but similar pud rates in ra and osteoarthritis ( oa ) patients ( ra 15 % , oa 18 % ) . this suggests that a common factor ( probably drugs ) is responsible . we feel that the documented high incidence of pud in ra is most probably related to drug therapy . available methods cannot determine if pud ever occurs as a primary manifestation of ra . 
effect of corticosteroid therapy on blood monocyte superoxide generation in rheumatoid arthritis : studies in vitro and ex vivo . rates of superoxide ( sa ) generation by blood monocytes stimulated ex vivo were studied before and during corticosteroid treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) patients , in control patients and in healthy controls . the direct effect on stimulated sa production of pre-incubating cells with prednisolone in vitro was also studied . significant inhibition of monocyte sa output stimulated with igg-treated zymosan ( itz ) and fluoride ion ( f ) , but not serum-treated zymosan ( stz ) was demonstrated following steroid therapy in ra . no inhibitory effect of prednisolone could be demonstrated in vitro , using itz , stz and f as stimuli . our data on blood monocyte yields , size and cytochemistry suggest that the in vivo effect is due to a shift in blood monocyte traffic . 
comparison of methotrexate with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in refractory rheumatoid arthritis : a life-table analysis . methotrexate ( mtx ) appears to be useful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) refractory to other drugs but its long-term toxicity and efficacy are uncertain . a retrospective study of mtx in such patients in comparison with the purine analogues , azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine was made using life-table analysis . eighty-four patients took mtx in a median dose of 7.5 mg / week whilst 55 received purine analogues , 100 mg / day ( median ) . by 12 months , 19.3 % of patients had ceased mtx due to toxicity , compared with 29.3 % for purine analogues . toxicity severe enough to warrant stopping therapy was uncommon after 8 months with either drug . at 12 months 61.5 % of the mtx patients had achieved defined criteria of improvement compared with 25.6 % for the purine analogues ( p less than 0.05 ) . the number of patients improving on purine analogues did not increase substantially after 6 months , whereas the number improving with mtx continued to 12 months . mtx in a low-dose regimen is useful in refractory ra and superior to low-dose purine analogues . 
thioguanine-resistant mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases . cells with mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( hprt ) locus may be detected in vitro by their resistance to the toxic effects of thioguanine . we have assessed hprt mutants in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases who have been treated for long periods with cytotoxic drugs . the results from patients treated with cyclophosphamide were abnormal suggesting the presence of drug-induced mutations . the results from patients treated with chlorambucil or azathioprine did not differ from controls--either these drugs have not induced mutations or , more likely , the technique is not sufficiently sensitive to detect them . these possibilities are discussed . specific mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in patients with connective tissue diseases have not been previously recorded . 
intensive immunosuppression in intractable rheumatoid arthritis . twelve patients with intractable rheumatoid arthritis were treated with antilymphocyte globulin ( alg ) , prednisolone and a cytotoxic agent , usually azathioprine , and were followed for 1 year . there was a significant ( p less than 0.05 ) improvement in the mean score for early-morning stiffness , grip strength and the severity of nodules and vasculitis at 6 weeks and 3 months when compared to the initial visit . however , in most patients , this benefit was not sustained despite continued cytotoxic and steroid therapy . a rise in the haemoglobin and fall in esr was maintained throughout the study period . 
clinical tests for carpal tunnel syndrome : an evaluation . five clinical tests in common use for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndromes have been shown to have little diagnostic value , either individually or in various combinations . no physical sign is useful in the diagnosis of this condition , which should be suspected on the basis of presenting symptoms and confirmed by electrodiagnosis using standard median nerve conduction tests .

inhibitors of urinary stone formation in 40 recurrent stone formers . the excretion of four inhibitors of urinary stone formation ( zinc , magnesium , citrates and glycosaminoglycans ( gag ) was studied in 20 normal controls and 40 recurrent calcium stone formers who were placed on a fixed diet restricted in calcium , oxalates and purines . we were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of zn , mg or gag . in 11 patients , a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary ph value above 6. citrate concentration ( per litre ) and output ( per 24 h ) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33 % respectively of the determinations . the overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56 , a figure in agreement with previous data . 
fistula and sinus formation in xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis . a clinicopathological review and report of four cases . fistula or deep sinus formation as a complication of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis ( xpn ) has not been described previously in the british literature . we present the clinicopathological features of one case of a nephrodiaphragmatic sinus complicating xpn , and three cases of nephrocolic fistula , including the first recorded case of fistula in childhood xpn . the detailed clinical , radiological and pathological features of xpn and its complications are reviewed . total nephrectomy , together with primary excision of sinuses or fistulae , is the treatment of choice . 
renal metastases from carcinoma of the lung . five cases of clinically manifest solitary and bilateral renal lesions metastatic from the lung are presented . these cases are unusual in that renal metastases are usually silent lesions discovered at autopsy . review of the autopsy data from this hospital identified renal metastases in 19 % of patients who died from carcinoma of the lung . this incidence parallels that of other series . a solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases , especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement . more frequent use of the abdominal ct scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis . 
rigid ureteroscopy for the treatment of ureteric calculi : experience in 120 cases . over a 1-year period , rigid ureteroscopy has been used to retrieve ureteric calculi in 120 patients . the technical details , causes of failure and the complications are described . an initial success rate of 78 % was obtained . it was concluded that ureteroscopy should replace blind procedures for the extraction of ureteric stones . 
endoscopic correction of vesicoureteric reflux secondary to neuropathic bladder . eleven patients with vesicoureteric reflux secondary to neuropathic bladder were treated by endoscopic injection of pyrolised polytetrafluoroethylene ( polytef ) paste . thirteen of the 15 ureters treated showed disappearance of reflux after one injection . the amount of polytef paste injected varied from 0.2 to 0.9 ml ( mean 0.45 ml ) . there were no complications , except in one ureter where distension of the collecting system was slightly increased compared with the pre-operative urogram . 
influence of serotonin on lower urinary tract smooth muscle in vitro . the influence of serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ) on human detrusor and on pig detrusor , trigone , bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle was explored in a series of in vitro experiments . serotonin evoked a dose-dependent and reversible contraction of the detrusor . the reverse response was triggered in trigone , bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle--a dose-dependent and reversible relaxation . the maximum amplitude of this relaxation was 85 + / - 15 % of the relaxation produced by electrical nerve stimulation . the effect of serotonin was unaltered by blockade of ganglia , alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors , cholinergic receptors and prostaglandin synthesis . the serotonin antagonists ketanserin , methysergide and cyproheptadine partly inhibited the effect of serotonin . the antagonism differed in potency on strips of different origin . the antagonists were ineffective or minimally effective in blocking responses to nerve stimulation . the effect of serotonin was probably mediated by specific serotonin receptors different from the serotonin-s2-receptors predominating in vascular smooth muscle . serotonin is a potential neurotransmitter in lower urinary tract smooth muscle , but its importance in micturition physiology and pathophysiology is unknown . 
the pressure-volume plot and prediction of treatment outcome in female incontinence . a graphic representation of the micturition cycle by a pressure-volume plot has been obtained in 120 women , both incontinent patients and normal controls . the pattern of contraction during voiding allowed prediction of the outcome of treatment . patients with urethral sphincter incompetence and a sustained detrusor contraction had a good result from colposuspension even if detrusor instability was found during filling . where the urethral sphincter was competent , patients with urge incontinence with or without detrusor instability during filling cystometry had a good response to drugs , providing a sustained detrusor contraction was present during voiding . urethral sphincter incompetence was characterised by a low detrusor voiding pressure . 
a 5-year follow-up of undiagnosed haematuria . eighty-four patients with haematuria were seen during 1976 and 1977. this symptom was investigated but no definite cause could be found . five or more years later they were followed up . although some patients had experienced further urological symptoms , none was found to have developed a malignancy in the genito-urinary tract . possible causes of their bleeding are discussed . 
comparison of primary orchiectomy with oestrogen therapy in advanced prostatic cancer . a 2-year follow-up report of a national , prospective prostatic cancer study . two hundred and seventy-seven patients with advanced prostatic cancer were treated by either orchiectomy or oestrogen . during the 2-year follow-up period , the response to treatment was considered more favourable in the oestrogen group , and this response was particularly emphasised in patients with poorly differentiated tumour and metastases at the time of diagnosis . further evaluations included the cardiovascular side effects of oestrogen therapy . 
fracture of the penis and long-term results of surgical treatment . twenty-five patients with fracture of the penis were treated surgically between 1968 and 1984. long-term follow-up was obtained in 17. in no case were there any early post-operative complications . all patients stated that they were achieving normal , painless erections ; two patients developed a slight penile curvature but this did not affect their sexual activities . we strongly recommend early surgical intervention because of these encouraging results . urethral injury associated with the fracture did not occur in this series .

movement deficits caused by hyperexcitable stretch reflexes in spastic humans . spastic patients were instructed to make accurate , rapid ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion movements over different distances to a target . ankle position and surface electromyograms ( emgs ) from tibialis anterior ( ta ) and soleus ( sol ) muscles were recorded . in 3 of 8 spastic patients tested , dorsiflexion evoked velocity-dependent activation of the antagonist ( sol ) muscle which impeded the movement to the extent that the limb unintentionally reversed movement direction . we propose that this activation is reflex in origin since it is tightly synchronized , has a large peak amplitude , occurs about 50 ms after the initiation of the movement , and is velocity dependent . one of the 3 patients who had reflex-induced antagonist activation in dorsiflexion also demonstrated sustained clonus during plantarflexion . this usually occurred only if the target had been overshot so that the return of the limb stretched the soleus muscle and triggered clonus . we conclude that in some patients , hyperactive stretch reflexes cause movement deficits . 
the contributions of motor cortex , nigrostriatal dopamine and caudate-putamen to skilled forelimb use in the rat . skilled forelimb use was studied in rats with unilateral lesions of the sensorimotor cortex , the caudate-putamen , or the dopaminergic nigrostriatal bundle , in a task involving reaching for food . limb preference and efficiency were evaluated , as well as the relationship between limb use , spontaneous , and methamphetamine-induced rotation bias , both preoperatively and postoperatively . to induce use of the nonpreferred limb , a bracelet , which prevented reaching but not other movements , was attached to the forearm of the preferred forelimb . whereas small cortical lesions of the forepaw area of the sensorimotor cortex mildly influenced limb preference and use , larger lesions changed preference . furthermore , medium-sized sensorimotor cortex lesions impaired contralateral limb use , although surprising recovery occurred on the forced tests with the bracelet . large cortical lesions abolished effective reaching even on the forced tests . impairments similar to those following sensorimotor cortex lesions were also obtained following small and large caudate-putamen lesions . by contrast , unilateral dopamine depletions not only blocked use of the limb contralateral to the depletion but also impaired use of the ipsilateral limb . there was recovery in use of the ipsilateral forelimb but not the contralateral forelimb . correlational analysis showed a weak relation between methamphetamine-induced rotation and limb preference preoperatively but no significant relation between these two variables postoperatively . the similarity in the deficits following sensorimotor cortex lesions and basal ganglia lesions suggests that skilled forelimb use depends upon a shared neural organization within the two systems . 
frontal lobe dysfunction in parkinson 's disease . the cortical focus of neostriatal outflow . this study investigates the hypothesis that , as a consequence of parkinson 's disease , disturbed caudate outflow will lead to deficits in cognitive functions dependent upon the integrity of the prefrontal cortex , the cortical focus of caudatofugal signals . since parkinson 's disease also involves lesions in extra-striatal midbrain cells which reduce the extrinsic supply of dopamine to this cortical region , such functions are at double risk . forty nondemented parkinsonian patients were drawn from a pool of 100 consecutive patients and matched with 40 normal control subjects according to age , education , iq , and sex . all patients were quantitatively rated on neurological indices of disease . neuropsychological assessment of the patient and normal groups included tests of general intelligence , psychomotor skills , memory , visuospatial and executive functions . no global cognitive decline was observed in the parkinsonian group . moreover , memory and visuospatial abilities were generally intact . a small cluster of deficits emerged , interpreted as reflecting impairment in the ability to spontaneously generate efficient strategies when relying on self-directed task-specific planning . in addition , several tests thought to be sensitive to frontal lobe function distinguished patients with symptoms strongly lateralized to the right versus left side of the body . deficits in strategic planning were later investigated in relation to severity of disease and to patient attributes including iq and age , both of which were relevant to performance on specific tasks . results were compared with previous investigations in parkinsonian patients and discussed from the perspective of both animal and human studies involving damage to the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia . as the prefrontal cortex is thought to play a crucial role in self-directed behavioural planning , the validity of an outflow model in predicting the consequences of caudate nucleus dysfunction was supported . 
the effect of doxorubicin on slow and fast components of the axonal transport system in rats . the study was designed to investigate the changes in axonal transport that result from disturbances in protein synthesis . doxorubicin , an antineoplastic drug which interferes with the function of dna , has a selective effect on peripheral sensory nerves because of the high vascular permeability in the dorsal root ganglia . after the intravenous administration of a moderate dose ( 4 mg / kg ) to male wistar rats , the transport of slow component a ( sca ) was found to be retarded , transport velocity being decreased by 17 % ( 0.85 + / - 0.06 mm / day vs 1.03 + / - 0.06 mm / day in controls ) . the transport kinetics of the fast anterograde and retrograde components ( afc and rfc ) were unchanged after the administration of a dose of 6 mg / kg , although the relative amount of afc was decreased by 27 % ( 3.2 + / - 0.9 % vs 4.4 + / - 1.1 % in controls ) . it is suggested that the neuronopathy induced by doxorubicin is mediated by changes in axonal transport . 
the clinical features of mitochondrial myopathy . the clinical features of 66 patients with histologically defined mitochondrial myopathy are described . the age of onset of symptoms ranged from birth to 68 years , but was before 20 years in 61 % . nineteen patients had similarly affected relatives . three groups of cases could be identified clinically : a combination of progressive external ophthalmoplegia and weakness of the limbs induced or increased by exertion ( 55 % ) ; such limb weakness alone ( 18 % ) ; and those with clinical features , such as ataxia , dementia , deafness , involuntary movements and seizures , predominantly or exclusively arising from the cns ( 27 % ) . there was considerable overlap between these groups , and pigmentary retinopathy , present in 36 % of patients , occurred in all three . at a mean disease duration of twenty years , 9 patients ( all from group 3 ) were severely disabled but 42 were still able to work . in vitro studies of mitochondrial metabolism , performed in 33 cases , most commonly showed deficiencies of the mitochondrial respiratory chain localized to complex i ( 18 patients ) or complex iii ( 9 ) . no typical clinical picture emerged for any of the identifiable biochemical defects . 
focal loss of anterior horn cells in the cervical cord in motor neuron disease . in a three-dimensional study of the distribution of anterior horn cells in the c8 segment of the human spinal cord we have recognized lateral and medial zones of motor neuron groupings , but have not been able to recognize subgroups of neurons within these groupings resembling the anatomical columns described by earlier investigators . this observation does not invalidate the concept of functional groupings within these anterior horn cell pools . in studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease , zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified , without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels . these findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons . 
effects of early and late transection of the corpus callosum in children . a study of tactile and tactuomotor transfer and integration . five children , aged 6 to 16 years , were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy . comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children . bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms . the most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways . the relatively greater deficits observed in the older children , on the other hand , suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity . 
suppressor t cells in family members of patients with multiple sclerosis . previous serial measurements of lymphocyte subpopulations in individuals with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) have demonstrated periodic reductions in the number of okt8 positive ( t8+ ) cells . in this longitudinal study , involving twice monthly samples from each participant and carried out in two phases lasting at least six and three months respectively , we have confirmed that fluctuations in t8+ cells occur in patients with ms and also found a significant reduction in this lymphocyte subpopulation in patients ' spouses but not their siblings , compared with unrelated controls . the changes observed in spouses were related in time to those occurring in patients on 10 / 13 occasions from 5 / 9 families ; no temporal relationship occurred in the remainder . taking two or more low t8+ values as significant , 12 / 13 patients , 7 / 9 spouses , 6 / 13 siblings and 4 / 13 controls ( chi 2 = 12.5 ; p less than 0.01 ) were abnormal at some stage . our results provide indirect evidence for the role of environmental factors in determining certain immunological abnormalities present in patients with ms and illustrate the role of family studies in determining the specificity of these changes to the disease . 
visuospatial function in parkinson 's disease . previous research on visuospatial function in parkinson 's disease is reviewed . the present experiment was designed to test two fundamental aspects of spatial ability , namely right-left discrimination and the manipulation of those concepts in different spatial perspectives . measures of accuracy and reaction time were taken . the performance of patients with parkinson 's disease did not differ from that of normal subjects in the spatial components of the task . neither a review of the literature , nor the results of the present study , give support to the idea of a generalized visuospatial deficit in parkinson 's disease . 
early detection of extravascular lung water in an inhalation injury animal model [ published erratum appears in burns incl therm inj 1987 feb ; 13 ( 1 ) : 82 ] a rabbit inhalation injury model using a dual tracer radioactive isotope technique ( rowland et al . , 1986 ) , has been utilized with small- and medium-sized molecular weight tracers . there is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation and especially with the combination of inhalation injury and fluid resuscitation [ corrected ] . this oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury . there does not appear to be any difference between the small- and medium-sized tracers in the transit times of tracer in the lung vascular compartment . the increases in extravascular water volume have been confirmed by gravimetric analyses of the lungs . thus the pulmonary oedema in the rabbit animal model is detectable within 2 h post-injury , with a return towards normal values some time within 24 h if fluid challenged for short periods . fluid resuscitation exacerbates the amount of oedema that developed . the onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically , and fluid resuscitation modifications may be of benefit in smoke inhalation injury . 
functional changes in rat-liver mitochondria during the early phase of burn injury . using succinate as a substrate , the respiratory control ratios of liver mitochondria from burned male sprague-dawley rats with full skin thickness burns covering 20 per cent of the body surface area were increased at 15 , 30 , 45 and 60 min after burn , the peak being at 30 min post-burn . a sham group acted as control . in comparison with the sham group , the specific activity of succinic dehydrogenase was slightly decreased and the activities of cytochromes b and c + c were decreased significantly 30 min after burning . all the results suggest a lack of increased metabolic activity during the early phase of burn injury . 
burn contracture of the neck-axillary region . 
use of scarred flaps and secondary flaps for reconstructive surgery of extensive burns . we report the usefulness of scar flaps and secondary flaps in the surgical repair of extensively burned patients . burn scar contractures repaired with scarred axial pattern flaps , scarred musculocutaneous flaps and scarred fasciocutaneous flaps are described . however , it is our contention that their application should be strictly limited . an example of the use of scarred secondary axial pattern and musculocutaneous flaps for reconstruction of a burned ear is shown . 
evaluation of e and eac rosette-forming cells in patients with thermal injuries . thermal injuries lead to changes in both the cell-mediated and humoral responses of the patient . this study was undertaken to assess these responses in the post-burn period and also to see if bacterial infection altered these responses . it has been concluded that alterations in the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses following thermal injuries are altered by infection and consequently are also important in the healing process . 
a multidisciplinary group approach to counselling the parents of burned children . this study has shown that a multidisciplinary group approach to counselling parents of burned children will decrease parental anxiety , and that medical , psychological and social problems will feature primarily in group discussions . 
epidemiology of industrial burns in brisbane . a retrospective epidemiological study of industrial burns admitted to the royal brisbane hospital was conducted over a period of 7 years . a total of 182 patients were included in this survey--173 males ( 95 per cent ) and 9 females ( 5 per cent ) . the proportion of industrial burns has decreased from 31.5 per cent to 18.5 per cent of total admissions to the burns unit over the past 10 years . fifty per cent of the burns occurred in males less than 30 years old . the average age was 31 years . two-thirds of the burns covered less than 10 per cent of the body and 84 per cent covered less than 20 per cent . while scalds were the commonest cause of industrial burns in our study ( 19.4 per cent ) , flame burns with clothing ignited caused the most extensive burns . face and hands were the most common sites involved . burns to these regions were mainly caused by flame and electrical burns . eye burns comprised 5.5 per cent of the sample and were due to chemicals , gas explosions and electric flash . twenty-six patients ( 14 per cent ) suffered respiratory injury . only one patient out of our series of 182 died . progress has been made in industrial safety in the past few years but carelessness and human error still take their toll . 
epidemiology of severe burn injuries . the epidemiology of severe burns is analysed . from 1 september 1982 to 31 august 1983 75 patients , 27 females and 48 males were admitted to the burns unit in copenhagen . the majority of burns were domestic and fire was the predominant cause . the most vulnerable areas were the arms and the legs , and small children still have the highest incidence of thermal injury . as predisposing factors were of significance in several accidents , the importance of further prevention is stressed . 
lightning injury caused by discharges accompanying flashovers--a clinical and experimental study of death and survival . during the 17 years preceding march 1985 , 140 patients sustained lightning injuries caused by 44 thunderbolts . fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies . these 50 victims were classified into two groups , the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet , indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers . the remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect . it is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived , whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived . the result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body , the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent . the conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally , imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them . the rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point , and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak . in contrast , the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds , and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape . it has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival . 
calcinosis cutis--a rare late complication of burns . pillars of calcification are rarely found in the skin . an interesting case is described where rows of new bone developed in the skin which had been grafted 31 years previously to cover partial skin thickness burns of the shin . the problems of heterotropic ossification are discussed . 
abdominal visceral perforation secondary to electrical injury : case report and review of the literature . a patient with a vesico-enteric fistula was successfully treated with resection of the small intestine and dome of the bladder and drainage of the intervening abscess . a search of the literature reveals this to be a very unusual complication of high-voltage electrical injury . 
the use of games in occupational therapy of hand burns . the need for active range of motion in hand burns is obvious and through adapted games the patient 's interest is aroused and provides an incentive for active participation in his / her therapeutic programme . all the games are for individual players , on different intellectual levels , and provide different active ranges of motion : for fingers , wrist , elbow and shoulder . most of the games were made by a former patient , now retired , copied from games in the collection of the occupational therapist , and some of the games are of israeli idea and manufacture . all the games can be gas autoclaved and therefore be used from patient to patient . the games also provide a much needed outlet for intellectual stimuli and distraction from the burns unit and all it signifies . 
the potential damaging effects of light on the eye ( part i ) . the electromagnetic spectrum consists of radiant energy that is classified according to specific wavelengths . man is constantly exposed to a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum , particularly to radiation in the ultraviolet , visible and infrared regions . the tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy . although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure , problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation . the cornea , lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet , visible and infrared range . part i of this two-part article examines the structures of the eye that are most susceptible to light damage ; part ii , which will be published in the next issue of the journal , focuses on eye protection . 
a new variable suction system with finger-tip control . we have developed a variable suction system for irrigation , aspiration and vitrectomy . the system is regulated by the operator 's finger-tip . 
supramaximal horizontal rectus surgery in the management of third and sixth nerve palsy . supramaximal medial and lateral rectus surgery was performed to correct horizontal deviations in seven cases of sixth nerve palsy and three cases of third nerve palsy , with satisfactory results in most cases . the advantages and disadvantages of such procedures are discussed . 
nerve fibre bundle visual field defects and intracranial mass lesions . nerve fibre bundle visual field defects are the hallmark of pathology at the optic nerve head or retina . in the present series , six eyes of four patients with large intracranial mass lesions demonstrated such field defects with visual acuity spared in three of the involved eyes . in no cases did visual function in the opposite eye offer a clue to the localization of the lesion . 
superior oblique myokymia : when treatment is necessary . a 56-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of torsional diplopia and right monocular oscillopsia . these symptoms , which had been intermittent at first , continued practically uninterrupted during the last 2 years . she was diagnosed as having superior oblique myokymia of the right eye . adequate trials of oral carbamazepine , baclofen and phenytoin were unsuccessful in suppressing her symptoms . one year after her initial presentation , she underwent a right superior oblique tenectomy and a right inferior oblique recession . she eventually required a second operation on her other eye to cure her of an annoying diplopia on down-gaze . 
signet-ring cell lymphoma in the orbit : a case report and review . the authors report on the first case of signet-ring cell lymphoma involving the orbit . this variant of non-hodgkin 's lymphoma contains either vacuolated or eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that squeeze the nucleus to one side of the cell . in this case , the inclusions were eosinophilic and stained positively for pas , immunoglobulin m ( igm ) heavy chain and kappa light chain . electron microscopy showed granular electron-dense material trapped within distended loops of rough endoplasmic reticulum . twenty-two cases of signet-ring cell lymphoma previously reported elsewhere in the body are reviewed , and their clinical significance is discussed .

drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis : report of 10 cases . between january 1979 and june 1985 , 10 patients with acute allergic interstitial nephritis were seen in a clinical nephrology service at a large regional hospital . the onset of renal failure was temporally related to the use of a drug : a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent ( nsaid ) ( in four patients ) , cimetidine ( in three ) , antibiotics ( in two ) or allopurinol ( in one ) . the onset of renal failure was acute in three patients and insidious in seven . two patients also exhibited marked proteinuria . clinical features such as fever , rash , hematuria , pyuria with or without eosinophiluria , and mild to marked proteinuria had led to suspicion of the disease . the diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy findings of inflammatory cells , predominantly lymphocytes , plasma cells and eosinophils . three patients required hemodialysis ; two of them received steroids as well . steroid therapy was also used in two patients with nsaid-induced proteinuria . renal function improved in nine patients by 35 days , but one patient continued to have slow but progressive deterioration of renal function . acute interstitial nephritis can be distinguished from other forms of acute renal failure by heavy renal uptake of gallium 67 , maximal 48 hours or more after injection . the improvement in renal function after discontinuation of the implicated drug , the characteristic histopathological findings of allergic interstitial nephritis , and the presence of eosinophils and sometimes ige in the blood suggest a hypersensitivity reaction .

changing motivation in severely suicidal patients . while the ambiguity of suicidal patients ' stated motivations has been studied in some detail , less attention has been given to the changeability of their motivations . twenty-six patients who had taken an overdose of paraquat , a highly lethal herbicide , were questioned about their motivation at the time of admission and 24 hours and 3 , 7 and 10 days later . although 25 patients claimed that they wished to die at the time of admission , all of the 14 surviving patients wished to live at the time of discharge from hospital . of the 12 patients who died , 6 stated that they no longer wished to die in the last interview before their death . during the following year 3 of the 14 surviving patients killed themselves . the findings emphasize the importance of thoroughly assessing all aspects of the suicidal patient 's situation in determining risks . the patient 's stated intentions should be but one factor considered . 
injuries associated with off-road vehicles among children . off-road vehicles have attained growing popularity , expanding markets and increasing rates of associated injury , especially among young people . in 1984-85 , 148 patients were treated at the children 's hospital of eastern ontario , ottawa , for injuries suffered in off-road vehicle accidents . the average age of the patients was 14 years . soft-tissue injuries occurred in 33 patients , 21 of whom had severe injuries . there were 179 fractures in 133 patients . one patient died as a result of his injuries . the most common mechanism of injury was losing control of and tumbling from the machine . seventeen patients were struck by their own vehicles , and 39 collided with objects such as cars , trees or people . the health care costs of these accidents are no less serious than the concerns for the appropriate legislation to protect consumers , particularly the young .

chromosome studies in preleukemic states . v . prognostic significance of single versus multiple abnormalities . the prognostic value of marrow chromosome findings was examined in 242 patients with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) or myeloproliferative disorders ( mpd ) , with emphasis on the significance of single versus multiple karyotypic changes . in both groups , the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early death , from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction . conversely , in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration ( involving a single chromosome or single translocation ) , survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality . the only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. these findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes . prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders . 
recombinant leukocyte a interferon ( rifn-alpha a ) in the treatment of disseminated malignant melanoma . analysis of complete and long-term responding patients . ninety-six patients with disseminated malignant melanoma received thrice weekly intramuscular injections of leukocyte a recombinant interferon ( rifn-alpha a , roferon-a , hoffmann la roche ) at doses of 12 x 10 ( 6 ) u / m2 or 50 x 10 ( 6 ) u / m2 with or without cimetidine as an immunorestorative agent . four patients , two with prior chemotherapy , demonstrated either a complete response ( 3 months , soft tissue metastasis ) or exceptionally durable response durations ( months ) of 29+ ( soft tissue ; lung lesion ) , 31+ ( soft tissue ) , and 35+ ( soft tissue ; liver lesions ) . none of these patients had particularly characteristic clinical parameters . as noted previously , using chemotherapy , a small proportion of patients with advanced malignant melanoma , despite prior therapy , may achieve prolonged objective regression with rifn-alpha a . 
nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors in children . a review of 89 cases from the pediatric oncology group , 1971-1984 . clinical and morphologic features of 89 cases of childhood yolk sac tumor ( ys ) and embryonal carcinoma ( ec ) ( 29 associated with teratomas ) submitted to the rare tumor registry of the southwest oncology group ( 1971-1979 ) or the pediatric oncology group ( 1980-1984 ) between 1971 and 1984 were reviewed and submitted to statistical analysis . this review showed an improved survival for each 5-year period regardless of tumor site , no statistically significant difference between " pure " tumors and those mixed with other teratomatous components , no statistically significant difference between ys and ec in children , a better than reported prognosis for sacrococcygeal tumors occurring after the neonatal period , a particularly poor prognosis for neonatal " benign " sacrococcygeal teratomas resected without coccygectomy when they recur as ys , excellent survival for all testicular tumors regardless of age or the presence of ec , and the occurrence of mediastinal tumors in females . 
phase ii trial of methylglyoxal bis ( guanylhydrazone ) ( mgbg ) in advanced head and neck cancer . methylglyoxal bis ( guanylhydrazone ) ( mgbg ) is an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis . in vitro studies demonstrate the accumulation of some tumor cells in s and g2 phases of the cell cycle . nineteen patients with advanced head and neck cancer were entered in a phase ii trial of mgbg . mgbg , 500 mg / m2 , was administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks , then every 2 weeks . dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly treatments . all but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease recurrence . of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity , one brief partial response was observed . the most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and stomatitis . myelosuppression occurred in three patients . dose modifications were required in four patients ; a maximum dose of 700 mg / m2 was tolerated . the results of four other phase ii single and combination chemotherapy trials of mgbg in head and neck cancer are reviewed . the single agent response rate in 59 patients was 22 % ( range , 6 % -41 % ) . the poor response rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated . it is concluded that single agent mgbg is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients . however , because of its biochemical effects , further testing in combination with cycle specific agents and in larger numbers of patients with minimal prior treatment may be warranted . 
clinical course of breast cancer patients with osseous metastasis treated with combination chemotherapy . between july 1973 and december 1979 , 1171 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy . of those patients , 195 had osseous metastases only . upon initial diagnosis , 48 % had osteolytic metastases ; 13 % had osteoblastic metastases ; 38 % had mixed metastases ; and 1 % had diffuse osteoporosis without any obvious bone destruction . the most common sites of involvement were the dorsal spine ( 62 % ) , lumbosacral spine ( 72 % ) , and pelvis ( 79 % ) . objective response to chemotherapy was observed in 59 % of patients ; complete responses were noted in 7 % , and partial responses in 52 % . the median survival was 28 months ( range , 1-118 months ) . the median time lapse between the start of chemotherapy and disease progression was 14 months ( range , 1-109 months ) . in 32 patients who responded to the treatment , chemotherapy was discontinued after 2 years , and their median duration of continued remission at 39 and 75 months after the completion of therapy . the incidence of pathological fractures was 57 % ; the most common sites were the spine , which sustained compression fractures , and the ribs . the incidences of hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression due to metastases were 19 % and 10 % , respectively . 
chemotherapeutic complete remission in patients with metastatic ovarian dysgerminoma . potential for cure and preservation of reproductive capacity . two patients with metastatic dysgerminoma of the ovary were treated with a combination of etoposide , bleomycin , and cisplatin at the university of texas m.d. anderson hospital and tumor institute at houston . both patients achieved a complete remission . patient 1 developed a massive recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes 21 months after diagnosis and treatment with right salpingo-oophorectomy alone . she received four cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 21 months from the start of chemotherapy . patient 2 had stage iii dysgerminoma and a lymphangiogram positive for tumor in the para-aortic lymph nodes . after surgery she received three cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 20 months from the start of chemotherapy . both complete remissions were documented with second-look laparotomy . chemotherapy may be an alternative to radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic dysgerminoma and should also be considered for selected patients with stage i disease . a literature review further supports the conclusion that additional clinical trials might expand the indications for chemotherapy in patients with this disease . 
long-term survival and morbidity in patients with metastatic malignant germ cell tumors treated with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy . forty-three of 79 patients treated for clinically metastatic germ cell cancer survived for a median of 66 months ( range , 52-83 ) . in patients without previous chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate was 69 % , whereas only 32 % of patients with prior chemotherapy survived for 5 years . limited disease , complete clinical response , histopathologically proven postchemotherapy tumor necrosis or complete resectability of a posttreatment mature teratoma indicated a favorable prognosis in patients without prior chemotherapy . only 20 % to 30 % of the patients with less than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor can be salvaged by second line therapy . posttreatment mature teratoma should be resected completely whenever possible , as this condition may lead to reactivation of the malignancy even after several years . raynaud-like phenomena and / or gastrointestinal problems are the main long-term sequel ( 10 % -15 % ) after modern multimodality treatment of advanced germ cell cancer ( fertility-related problems are not considered here ) . in the majority of surviving patients , the lifestyle seems unaffected by the previous intensive treatment , evaluated about 5 years after discontinuation of all therapy . 
infants younger than 1 year of age with rhabdomyosarcoma . of a total of 1561 patients registered in the intergroup rhabdomyosarcoma study ( irs ) as of may 1983 , 78 patients ( 5 % ) were younger than 1 year of age . these infants did not differ from the older children ( 1-20 years of age ) in male / female ratio , clinical grouping , or survival rates . infants younger than 1 year of age had a significantly greater frequency of undifferentiated sarcoma , 18 % versus 7 % in older children ( p less than 0.005 ) . infants also had a significantly greater proportion of cancers with botryoid pathology , 10 % versus 4 % in older children ( p less than 0.005 ) . when reviewed by the newly proposed irs cytopathologic classification , there was no difference in pathologic types between the two age groups . infants younger than 1 year of age had a higher rate of bladder-prostate-vagina primary tumor sites than older children , 24 % versus 10 % ( p less than 0.05 ) . in addition , infants tended to receive less of the prescribed doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy than older children , and to develop more toxicity to treatment than older children . despite these differences , the overall survival curve for the two age groups appears to be similar . in contrast to wilms ' tumor and neuroblastoma , in which age ( less than 1 year ) is a favorable prognostic factor , age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in rhabdomyosarcoma . 
treatment of advanced stage mycosis fungoides with bleomycin , doxorubicin , and methotrexate with topical nitrogen mustard ( bam-m ) . ten patients with advanced stage ( tnm iib-ivb ) mycosis fungoides were treated with a combination chemotherapy program consisting of bleomycin and methotrexate weekly , doxorubicin every 3 weeks , and topical nitrogen mustard daily ( bam-m ) . seven patients obtained histologically documented complete remissions ranging from 4 to 105+ months in duration . median survival is 16.5+ months . three patients in whom splenomegaly was detected during their staging evaluation underwent splenectomy . these three patients have had unmaintained disease-free survivals of 36+ , 100+ , and 105+ months . this study indicates that bam-m is effective therapy for advanced stage mycosis fungoides and suggests that the therapeutic role of splenectomy should be evaluated further . 
value of gallium scans and lymphangiography in non-hodgkin 's lymphoma of the waldeyer 's ring . in 37 patients with seemingly localized non-hodgkin 's lymphoma of the waldeyer 's ring ( wr-nhl ) , lymphangiography ( lag ) and / or gallium-67 scans ( ga-67 scans ) were done . before these procedures , 20 patients were diagnosed as stage i , and 17 as stage ii . lag was done for 30 , and ga-67 scans for 32 , 25 of whom had both . five patients ( 16 % ) were upstaged to stage iii or iv by ga-67 scans . only one ( 3 % ) had abnormal lag findings , in whom ga-67 scans also showed abnormal accumulation in the para-aortic region . because of this low positive rate , lag is not recommended for staging of wr-nhl . 
cell mediated and humoral immune responses in oral submucous fibrosis . cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were assessed in 50 patients with oral submucous fibrosis ( osmf ) and the results were compared with those of 50 patients with oral-leukoplakia , 50 oral cancer patients , and 50 normal healthy adult controls . the number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells ( harfc ) was found to be significantly decreased in osmf and oral cancer , whereas the number of total rosette-forming cells ( trfc ) remained unaltered . levels of serum iga , igd , and ige were found to be elevated both in osmf and oral cancer . immunologic derangements were found to be more pronounced in oral cancer than in osmf . the enumeration of harfc along with the estimation of serum levels of iga , igd , and ige indicates that osmf can be an intermediary stage in the malignant transformation of a normal cell , and that these parameters may serve as markers for the early detection of oral cancer . 
tuberculosis-associated hemophagocytic syndrome . a systemic process . virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome has been recently identified as a benign , reactive histiocytic proliferation distinct from rappaport 's malignant hystiocytosis . other etiologic agents , including different bacteria , have also been identified . three autopsy cases of hemophagocytic syndrome associated to acute tuberculous sepsis are presented . benign histiocytic proliferation with striking hemophagocytosis was present in a disseminated , multisystemic pattern in all three cases . a relationship between systemic histiocytic proliferation and an anergic status in these patients is suggested . 
malignant lymphoma of bone . a total of 422 patients with malignant lymphoma of bone who were seen at the mayo clinic from 1907 through 1982 were placed into four major groups based on stage of disease . there was one group with primary lymphoma of bone , one group with multifocal osseous lymphoma , and two groups with lymphoma of bone and nodal or soft tissue ( or both ) disease . the last-mentioned two groups were separated on the basis of time of onset of osseous lymphoma in relation to the nonosseous disease . the stage of disease was the single most important prognostic indicator of overall survival in malignant lymphoma of bone . the 5- and 10-year survival rates were , respectively , 58 % and 53 % for patients with primary bone lymphoma , 22 % and 12.5 % for patients with bone and nodal or soft tissue ( or both ) disease , and 42 % and 35 % for patients with multifocal osseous disease . features having no significant prognostic value were sex of the patient , histologic grade of the lymphoma ( according to the working formulation and the kiel system ) , and presence of t-cell features or cleaved cells ( or both ) . this study is not able to adequately address efficacy of treatment . in fact , treatment may be very important in outcome . 
meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer . report of six cases and review of the literature . head and neck cancer has rarely been reported to be a cause of meningeal carcinomatosis . these tumors are known more for their local invasiveness rather than distant metastasis . this would appear to preclude meningeal involvement , but close proximity to multiple cranial nerves may provide an access to the meninges . six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented . all six cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid . three cases had malignant cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative . the most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement . the optic nerve was involved most often with nerves vi and v the next most frequent . headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two . no patient had meningismus . our current treatment plan involves insertion of an ommaya reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate . only patients whose primary head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo ommaya placement . meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather than hematogenous spread . 
serum testosterone level of patients with gastric carcinoma before and after gastrectomy . the serum testosterone level ( stl ) was determined in 84 male and 32 female patients with gastric carcinoma and in 58 male and 20 female patients with benign diseases as a control group . the stl of the male patients with carcinoma was lower ( 446 + / - 149 ng / dl ) than that of the male control group ( 532 + / - 132 ng / dl ) ( p less than 0.001 ) . even 17 male patients of the early carcinoma showed lower stl ( 440 + / - 117 ng / dl ) than the normal group ( p less than 0.001 ) . in the female patients , it was also lower ( 31.6 + / - 16.0 ng / dl ) than in the control group ( 46.3 + / - 15.3 ng / dl ) ( p less than 0.005 ) . the postoperative stl of the cases surviving the gastrectomy was higher than the preoperative data in 32 male patients ( p less than 0.005 ) as well as in 12 female patients ( 0.025 greater than p greater than 0.01 ) , whereas it obviously decreased in the patients who died of recurrence . therefore , it appears that gastric carcinoma decreases the stl by some mechanism . 
total and lipid-associated serum sialic acid levels in cancer patients with different primary sites and differing degrees of metastatic involvement . serum total sialic acid ( tsa ) and lipid-associated sialic acid ( lasa ) levels have drawn considerable interest because of carbohydrate aberrations in malignant cells . the current investigation determined the tsa , lasa , total protein ( tp ) , and tsa / tp values for 171 cancer patients with various primary sites and differing degrees of metastatic disease , 102 patients with nonmalignant diseases ( pathologic controls ) , and 42 normal individuals . data analysis indicated significant ( p less than 0.01 ) increases in the mean ( + / - sd ) tsa and tsa / tp values in the cancer patients ( 78.1 + / - 19.2 mg / dl and 12.4 + / - 3.8 mg / g , respectively ) and in the pathologic controls ( 76.0 + / - 7.5 mg / dl and 11.6 + / - 2.5 mg / g ) when compared to the normal controls ( 67.3 + / - 7.1 mg / dl and 9.0 + / - 1.1 mg / g ) , and a significant decrease in the mean tp values in the cancer patients ( 6.4 + / - 1.1 g / dl ) and pathologic controls ( 6.6 + / - 1.1 g / dl ) when compared to normal controls ( 7.5 + / - 0.5 g / dl ) . no significant difference was observed between groups in lasa values . further analysis of the data in patient subgroups based on the tissue involved , specific disease , or severity of the malignancy indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to restricted subgroups and that the sensitivity of tsa and tsa / tp increased as the malignancy became more severe . the results show that tsa / tp was the most useful of the markers tested for detecting malignancies . this marker should prove useful for monitoring malignant disease recurrence and / or progression and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches . 
chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone . diagnosis and treatment of 13 cases and review of the literature . chondrosarcoma of the temporal bone is a rare lesion . clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis , glomus jugulare tumors , meningioma , and chordomas . the cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors . thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed . histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features . the myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma . the tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae . proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects . 
diffuse subependymal periventricular metastases . report of three cases . three clinicopathologic cases with a remarkable pattern of extensive diffuse subependymal periventricular spread of cerebral metastases from solid systemic cancer are reported . two patients had a small cell carcinoma of the lung . in the third case , the histologic features of the brain metastases were consistent with a neuron-specific enolase-positive , small cell anaplastic carcinoma . involvement of the choroid plexus and leptomeninges was moderate or absent . intraparenchymatous nodular metastases were not found except in one case in which rare nodular superficial cortical metastases were present . the clinical data were nonspecific except for orthostatic hypotension , in one patient , which was probably due to the infiltration of the floor of the third and fourth ventricles . results of the cerebrospinal fluid examination , available in two cases , were normal . the only diagnostic investigation was contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning . 
prognostic factors in neuroblastomas treated in denmark from 1943 to 1980. a statistical estimate of prognosis based on 253 cases . multivariate analysis on an unselected patient population consisting of all 253 children treated for neuroblastoma in denmark during 1943 to 1980 shows that stage , age , and treatment given are independent prognostic variables . calendar year of diagnosis , sex of the patient , and site of primary tumor were not significant prognostic factors . further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery , irradiation , and chemotherapy , especially in patients older than 1 year of age with stage ii disease , has influenced the survival significantly . the fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital ; therefore , the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor . thus , according to this theory , age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease , as it represents the duration of the disease . additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children , since the age influence on stage ii disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study . the implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this theory . 
familial breast cancer in males . a case report and review of the literature . the occurrence of breast cancer in two related males , an uncle and nephew is reported . a review of previously reported cases of male breast cancer occurring in families and the association with other cancers in other family members is included . in previous reports on breast cancer in males , familial or hereditary factors have not generally been recognized as a major contributing factor . of ten families reported ( including our own ) where there is sufficient information given , six families ( 60 % ) had females with breast cancer . it appears there are some families in which males as well as females have an increased risk of developing breast cancer . 
pleuroperitoneal shunting for malignant pleural effusions . traditional therapy for malignant pleural effusions includes thoracentesis or tube drainage with instillation of irritants to achieve pleurodesis . this can require a lengthy hospitalization , causes pain and discomfort , and has an appreciable failure rate . because of these drawbacks , the authors used a shunting device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant pleural effusions . eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis . the shunt was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal catheters , which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal abdominal / pleural pressure gradient . operative placement under local or general anesthesia was performed without complication . five patients achieved minimal benefit , either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the pump effectively . in the other 12 patients , there was radiographic evidence of diminished or stabilized pleural effusion ; respiratory symptoms were effectively palliated , and no further treatment for their effusion was required . peritoneal dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected . we feel that pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low morbidity . advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement . shunting is applicable for patients who are able to perform the requisite pumping and is particularly suitable for those with trapped lungs or who have failed attempted pleural sclerosis . 
cardiac abnormalities in patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma . many patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma have dyspnea or chest pain . cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease . to better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma , the electrocardiographic ( ekg ) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed . a total of 19 / 64 ( 30 % ) patients had autopsy studies available for review . the ekg was abnormal in 55 patients ( 89 % ) . over half ( 60 % ) had an arrhythmia , including sinus tachycardia ( 42 % ) , premature atrial and ventricular contractions ( 13 % ) , atrial fibrillation ( 3 % ) , and atrial flutter ( 1 % ) . over one third ( 37 % ) had a conduction abnormality , including bundle branch block ( 13 % ) , hemiblock ( 8.5 % ) , and incomplete right bundle branch block ( 13 % ) . echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions , two with pericardial thickening , and one with an anterior sonolucent space . of 19 autopsies , cardiac invasion was found in 14 ( 74 % ) , with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium . it is concluded that : clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma , pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma , and the ekg and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma . 
monitoring intravesical bacillus calmette-guerin treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma by serial flow cytometry . simultaneous urinary flow cytometry , cytologic , and cystoscopic examinations were performed at 3-month intervals for a minimum of 1 year on 29 patients receiving intravesical bacillus calmette-guerin ( bcg ) treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma . flow cytometry ( fcm ) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations ; both fcm and cytology were positive in 38 instances , and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 ( 92.1 % ) . in 16 instances fcm and cytology were negative , but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 ( 31.3 % ) . three examinations were suspicious by both techniques . the 46 determinations with discordant fcm and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences ( 25 instances ) and no evidence of pathologic and / or cystoscopic disease ( 21 instances ) . in the 25 instances of recurrences , fcm was positive in 18 ( 72.0 % ) , suspicious in 3 ( 12.0 % ) , and negative in 4 ( 16.0 % ) , while cytology was positive in 3 ( 12.0 % ) , suspicious in 9 ( 36.0 % ) , and negative in 13 ( 52.0 % ) . most patients had a severe bcg-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population , believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation . in the 21 instances without detectable recurrence , hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive ( 15 ) and suspicious ( 4 ) results by fcm , but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations . it is possible that this latter group , at least , is harboring occult carcinoma . conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 ( 4.8 % ) , suspicious in 7 ( 33.3 % ) , and negative in 13 ( 61.9 % ) . in those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy , the false-negative rate for fcm was 19.7 % ; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9 % . thus , fcm appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology , having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate . although serial fcm provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical bcg therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma , it should still be used with conventional cytology . the greatest difficulty with fcm at present , as with conventional cytology , is in cases of marked inflammation . the results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy . potential improvements in the technique , with the addition of immunologic or other markers , hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of fcm . 
transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder . effects of preoperative irradiation on morphology . the effects of preoperative irradiation on the morphology of transitional cell carcinomas ( tccs ) were evaluated by studying the pretreatment biopsy and radical cystectomy specimens from 35 patients . twenty-six of these patients had received 2000 rad within the week preceding surgery , and nine patients had received no preoperative treatment . the frequency of bladders without residual tcc was 23 % for irradiated and 22 % for nonirradiated cases . of the tccs classified as papillary in the biopsy specimens and irradiated , 79 % lacked a papillary component at cystectomy , but in no case was the invasive component eliminated or regression from muscle invasion to superficial tcc noticed . flat carcinoma in situ ( cis ) did not respond to irradiation . at cystectomy nuclear pleomorphism was greater than at biopsy in 60 % of the irradiated tccs , whereas all nonirradiated cases retained the same grade as at biopsy . in addition , irradiation induced squamous differentiation in neoplastic cells only , without affecting the nonneoplastic urothelium . 
the right heart . 
assessment of right and left heart interactions : application of the resistance ratio in chronic congestive heart failure . 
effect of the left ventricle on the right ventricle . the importance of the once-obscure right ventricle is becoming evident . even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle , the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output . in coronary artery disease , the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle . in congestive heart failure , right ventricular function relates to functional capacity , whereas left ventricular function does not , and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients . in mitral and aortic valvular disease , the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident , and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained . in systemic hypertension , it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures . 
the pathology of the right heart in chronic hypertrophy and failure . 
perioperative right heart failure : etiology and pathophysiology . a considerable amount of literature has been devoted to compromise of the right ventricle in spontaneous myocardial infarction . little information is available regarding disproportionate dysfunction of the right ventricle associated with cardiac operation and the recovery period therefrom . recognition of the problem is of paramount importance , if support measures are to be implemented . a great deal has yet to be learned regarding the appropriate support for the acutely failing right ventricle . much remains to be accomplished regarding the assessment of right ventricle reserve , defining the role of risk factors , and quantitating the value of measures to optimally protect the right ventricle from injury during the perioperative period . recognizing that the integrity of the right ventricle can be altered by numerous preoperative , perioperative and postoperative factors will provide an enlightened disposition on the part of the surgical team . awareness of these considerations in the planning and conduct of surgical procedures should reduce morbidity and mortality from perioperative right ventricular failure . the imposition of new or unexpected morbidity during operation on a relatively unrelated problem represents surgical imperfection . appropriate effort toward minimizing insult of the right ventricle could result in significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of perioperative right ventricular failure before the impetus of the continuing clinical problem dictates improvement in techniques to more appropriately treat this frequently preventable problem . 
perioperative right heart failure : treatment . when right ventricular failure prohibits separation from cardiopulmonary bypass , standard methods of increasing pulmonary blood flow should be employed , including correction of hypoxia and acidosis , volume loading , and inotropic support of the right ventricle . infusion of pulmonary vasodilators--particularly low-dose nitroprusside--should be used if the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated . if pulmonary blood flow remains unsatisfactory , systemic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be employed . in refractory cases , right-atrial-to-pulmonary-artery bypass using the bio-medicus centrifugal pump is the recommended therapy for those centers that do not have the pierce-donachy pneumatic ventricular assist-pump available . for refractory right ventricular failure following the surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects in which the placement of right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulae is not technically feasible , use of high-frequency high-volume ventilation appears to be quite promising . utilization of pulmonary artery counterpulsation or the creation of an atrial septal defect may also be lifesaving , but is not recommended as the therapy of choice . 
right ventricular failure associated with left ventricular failure . rv and lv failure frequently coexist . experimental evidence suggests that rv failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance . lv failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient . because rv function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle , this contribution is reduced during lv failure . treatment should be aimed first at restoring lv function . if rv failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem , treatment of rv failure should be commenced . if volume loading , inotropes , and ph adjustments do not result in adequate rv output , a mechanical assist device should be considered . rhbp is the most powerful device , and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual rv function . clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved rv function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment , allowing them to be weaned from assist . however , this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention . pabc is a simple but less powerful assist device . experimental studies suggest that if rv function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--pabc may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels . current results suggest that rhbp remains the gold standard for severe rv failure , but further clinical experience with pabc may more clearly define its role in the management of rv failure .

changes in intracardiac blood flow velocities and right and left ventricular stroke volumes with gestational age in the normal human fetus : a prospective doppler echocardiographic study . we used doppler echocardiography to quantitate the changes in intracardiac blood flow velocities and right and left ventricular stroke volumes in 80 normal human fetuses from 19 to 40 weeks gestation . blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic , pulmonary , tricuspid , and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities ( m / sec ) and flow velocity integrals . aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice . ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel . the pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age ( r = .82 , r = .84 ) , and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter . there was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age : stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle ( r = .87 ) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle ( r = .91 ) . similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs . in 44 % of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes . there was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses ( r = .96 ) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28 % .

racial ( black-white ) comparisons of the relationship of levels of endogenous sex hormones to serum lipoproteins during male adolescence : the bogalusa heart study . the cross-sectional relationship of endogenous androgens ( testosterone , androstenedione , and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [ dhea-s ] ) , estrogen ( estradiol ) and progestin ( progesterone ) to serum levels of lipoprotein cholesterol ( very low-density [ vldl ] , low-density [ ldl ] , and high-density lipoprotein [ hdl ] ) and apolipoproteins ( apo a-i and apo b ) were studied in white ( n = 251 ) and black ( n = 258 ) adolescent boys , ages 11 to 17 years , as part of the bogalusa heart study . black boys had significantly higher levels of estradiol , hdl cholesterol , and apo a-i , and lower levels of androstenedione and vldl cholesterol than white boys , independent of age and adiposity . age was correlated strongly with testosterone and androstenedione , and moderately with dhea-s and estradiol levels in both races . however , only in white boys was age consistently related to vldl cholesterol ( positively ) , hdl cholesterol ( negatively ) , and apo a-i ( negatively ) . overall , testosterone was associated inversely with hdl cholesterol and apo a-i in white boys , while progesterone was related positively to apo a-i in both races after adjusting for age and adiposity . however , these relationships were found to differ with age . partial correlations between levels of sex hormones and lipoproteins adjusted for age and adiposity showed no associations in the 11 to 12 year age group in boys of either race . a significant positive relation of testosterone to vldl cholesterol , and inverse relations of testosterone to hdl cholesterol and apo a-i and dhea-s to hdl cholesterol were apparent only in white boys in the 13 to 14 year age group .

optimal detection of the progression of coronary artery disease : comparison of methods suitable for risk factor intervention trials . to assess the best method of quantitating progression of coronary disease , we studied four measurements in 114 coronary segments from 35 medically treated patients from whom angiograms were obtained 5 years apart . only stenoses of less than 70 % that were visualized in nearly identical projections on both angiograms were evaluated . vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two " absolute dimensions " ( mean and minimum diameters ) and two measurements ( percent stenosis and atheroma area ) that required a " normal reference " diameter . the coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma . the best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time ( 6.7 + / - 14.1 % decrease ) , whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis ( p less than .001 ) . based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease , it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33 % reduction in disease progression ( 207 patients for 50 % reduction ) at a 95 % confidence level and 90 % power . 
resting angina with fixed coronary artery stenosis : nocturnal decline in ischemic threshold . atrial pacing was performed in 16 patients with angina at rest and significant coronary artery stenosis ( greater than 70 % ) over 2 consecutive days in the morning ( 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. ) , in the afternoon ( 4 to 7 p.m. ) , and at night ( 12 midnight to 3 a.m. ) to assess possible circadian variations of their ischemic threshold . overall , the incidence of resting angina was highest at night . all pacing results were positive ( greater than or equal to 1.0 mm st segment shift ) and tended to be reproducible in nine patients , whereas some or all were negative in seven . among all positive results , ischemic thresholds at night were significantly lower than those in the morning and in the afternoon ( 125 + / - 3 vs 138 + / - 3 and 139 + / - 2 beats / min , mean + / - sem ; p less than .005 ) . in nine patients , 19 pacing tests produced st segment elevation , of which 13 were performed at night ( 68 % ) . we conclude that patients with resting angina and severe coronary stenosis often exhibit a nocturnal decline in their ischemic threshold , which seems to facilitate development of transmural ischemia during atrial pacing . 
local coronary supersensitivity to diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli in patients with variant angina . it has been shown in different groups of patients with variant angina that coronary spasm can be reproduced by physiologic maneuvers and pharmacologic agents . it is not known , however , to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient . to investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli , 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm . ergonovine , hyperventilation , handgrip , cold pressor , and exercise-tests , were carried out in all 28 patients . in the last 15 patients histamine was also administered . spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96 % of patients , by hyperventilation in 54 % , by histamine in 47 % , by exercise in 46 % , and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11 % and 7 % , respectively . no significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions . in the same individual , spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli , although with a different mechanism of action , in 82 % of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39 % . tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity . these results suggest that in patients with variant angina , a local nonspecific supersensitivity rather than an abnormal specific agonist-receptor interaction plays a major role in the genesis of coronary arterial spasm . 
late potentials detected after myocardial infarction : natural history and prognostic significance . the risk of developing spontaneous ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) and / or sudden death ( " arrhythmic events " ) was prospectively assessed in 165 patients who survived acute myocardial infarction . signal-averaged electrocardiograms ( ecgs ) were performed before hospital discharge and then serially at regular intervals over the following year . in addition , 24 hr holter monitoring was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction was determined . sixty-five patients ( group 1 ) had abnormal signal-averaged ecgs ( voltage in the last 40 msec of the filtered qrs less than 20 microv or filtered qrs duration greater than 120 msec ) , 92 had normal signal-averaged ecgs ( group 2 ) , and eight had bundle branch block ( excluded from analysis ) . in group 1 , spontaneous normalization of the voltage in the last 40 msec of the qrs complex occurred in 30 % of patients after 12 months , although total filtered qrs duration did not change overall . during follow-up of up to 20 months ( median 11 ) , seven patients died suddenly and six presented again with spontaneous , symptomatic vt . eleven of 65 ( 17 % ) group 1 patients had an arrhythmic event compared with one of 92 patients ( 1 % ) in group 2 ( p less than .001 ) . the sensitivity of the signal-averaged ecg as a predictor of arrhythmic events was 92 % with a specificity of 62 % . patients with subsequent arrhythmic events had considerably lower voltage in the last 40 msec of the qrs ( 11.0 + / - 8.3 vs 32.0 + / - 21.9 microv ; p less than .001 ) than those without such events , and longer filtered qrs complexes ( 121 + / - 14 vs 105 + / - 12 msec ; p less than .001 ) . multivariate logistic regression determined that the signal-averaged ecg provided independent prognostic information from the presence of complex ventricular ectopy and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction assessed at the time of hospital discharge . signal-averaged ecgs provide important prognostic information in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction . dynamic changes in the terminal qrs voltage are observed during the first year after myocardial infarction . 
assessment of the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway in the intact failing human heart : progressive receptor down-regulation and subsensitivity to agonist response . we developed methods for identifying beta-adrenergic receptors in human right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy tissue with the radioligand ( - ) [ 125i ] iodocyanopindolol ( icyp ) . specific icyp binding in a crude , high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high ( specificity greater than 90 % ) , of high affinity ( kd around 20 pm ) , saturable and stereospecific for the ( - ) vs the ( + ) isomer of isoproterenol . subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2 % and 57.7 % when normalization methods were averaged , with no significant differences in icyp dissociation constant . a subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction ( lvef less than 0.50 greater than 0.40 ) and severe heart failure ( lvef less than 0.20 ) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate . those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dp / dt and stroke work index response , whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups . these data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors , heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction , reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure , and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response . 
maintenance of cardiac output with normal filling pressures in patients with dilated heart failure . therapy of elevated ventricular filling pressures in patients with dilated heart failure may be limited by concern that cardiac output will be further compromised . twenty-five patients with severe symptoms and ejection fractions of 25 % or less were studied to determine the lowest ventricular filling pressures that could be achieved with vasodilator and diuretic therapy while maintaining cardiac output . in 20 of 25 patients normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures ( pcws ) were achieved ( mean 10 mm hg compared with 30 mm hg at baseline ) . stroke volume was 60 vs 39 ml at baseline . stroke work index was 30 vs 19 g-m / m2 . for each patient , over the range of pcws , stroke volume and stroke work index were maintained and were often maximal at the lowest pcw achieved . the upright position was well tolerated in patients with normal supine pcw . normal filling pressures can be achieved in patients with congestive heart failure without compromise of cardiac output . while congestive symptoms should be improved , the feasibility and benefit of maintaining normal filling pressures over a long term must be established . 
hemodynamic predictors of outcome in patients undergoing valve replacement [ published erratum appears in circulation 1987 mar ; 75 ( 3 ) : 650 ] the afterload-corrected end-systolic volume index ( ratio of end-systolic stress to end-systolic volume index [ ess / esvi ] ) was previously useful in predicting outcome in patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing valve replacement . therefore we tested ess / esvi together with standard hemodynamic variables as possible predictors of outcome in 39 patients with various valvular lesions who underwent valve replacement . thirteen patients had preoperative mitral regurgitation , 16 had aortic stenosis , nine had aortic regurgitation , and one had mitral stenosis . twenty-seven patients ( group s ) had a satisfactory outcome as defined by a return to nyha class i or ii together with a normal postoperative ejection fraction . twelve patients who died , remained in class iii or iv , or had a subnormal postoperative ejection fraction were deemed to have an unsatisfactory result ( group u ) . mean right atrial pressure , pulmonary arterial pressure , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , end-diastolic volume index , end-systolic volume index ( esvi ) , and end-systolic wall stress were all greater in group u , whereas ess / esvi and ejection fraction were lower in group u . when these and other factors were submitted to stepwise discriminant multivariate analysis , ess / esvi and esvi were the only independent predictors of outcome . however , when patients with mitral regurgitation ( who might have biased the study ) were excluded , discriminant analysis showed esvi as the only independent predictive variable . we conclude that end-systolic indicators of ventricular function are superior to other standard hemodynamic variables in predicting outcome of valve replacement . 
color doppler detection of multiple ventricular septal defects . combined two-dimensional and doppler echocardiography has a high sensitivity and specificity for detection of isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defects . however , muscular or multiple ventricular septal defects may be difficult to diagnose with noninvasive methods , particularly in older children , necessitating angiography for accurate diagnosis . detection of single and multiple ventricular septal defects with two-dimensional color flow mapping was compared with detection by standard two-dimensional imaging and doppler . both techniques were compared with four-chamber left ventricular angiography . fifty-one patients ( age 3 months to 25 years , mean 5.6 years ) were studied . eighteen had solitary ventricular septal defects , 18 had multiple ventricular septal defects , and 15 patients with intact ventricular septum served as a control group . at least one ventricular septal defect was detected by color doppler and two-dimensional / doppler methods in all patients with ventricular septal defect proved by angiography with no false positives . in the detection of multiple ventricular septal defects , the sensitivity of color doppler was 72 % and that of two-dimensional / doppler was 38 % ( 100 % specificity in both ) . color doppler failed to identify multiple ventricular septal defects in five patients ( two weighing less than 4 kg and three with reduced pulmonary blood flow ) . however , no large additional muscular defects were missed by imaging and color doppler . color doppler is useful for the detection of ventricular septal defects and has higher sensitivity than two-dimensional / doppler for multiple ventricular septal defects . the contribution of color doppler appears to be in the detection of additional small muscular ventricular septal defects . 
characterization of the spatial distribution of late ventricular potentials by body surface mapping in patients with ventricular tachycardia . low-level activity at the end of the qrs complex was analyzed from 63 thoracic leads in 15 normal subjects and in 21 patients with ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) . the latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs . in both normal subjects and patients with vt , isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered ( 25 hz high-pass ) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the qrs were dipolar , i.e. , they showed single positive and negative regions . for patients with vt , the extrema were either distant , with one over the precordial area and the other over the back , or close together in the precordial region . in 10 patients , maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while qrs duration was prolonged . in six patients , maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal vt sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites . generally , qrs duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery . late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar , but maps provide additional information about their distribution , which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to vt sites of origin . sources near the torso surface would produce close extrema , whereas deeper sources would produce distant extrema . 
mapping of body surface potentials in patients with the idiopathic long qt syndrome . body surface potential maps were recorded from 140 chest leads in 25 patients affected by the idiopathic long qt syndrome ( lqts ) and in 25 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex . potential time integrals of the qrst and st-t intervals were calculated at each lead point and displayed as isointegral ( isoi ) maps . the main abnormalities noted on the qrst and st-t isoi maps were one area of negative values larger than normal in the right anterior and inferior thorax and a complex multipeak distribution of the integral values . at least one abnormality was present in 19 ( 76 % ) of the patients with lqts and four ( 16 % ) of the control subjects ( p less than .001 ) . each isoi map was also represented as a weighted sum of nine fundamental components ( eigenvectors ) to detect and quantitate the nondipolar content . the percent contribution of the nondipolar eigenvectors ( all eigenvectors beyond the third ) was significantly higher in the lqts group than in the control group ( p less than .005 ) . specifically , an abnormally high nondipolar content on the qrst isoi maps was observed much more frequently for patients with lqts than for control subjects ( nine or 36 % vs one or 4 % ) , and this was also true on the st-t isoi maps ( 14 or 56 % vs one or 4 % ) . no correlation was found between the major abnormalities on body surface maps and syncopal episodes . however , the high prevalence ( 76 % ) of these alterations among the patients with lqts and their infrequent occurrence in the control population strongly suggests that they may be useful markers for the diagnosis of atypical cases . the prominent electronegative area on the anterior thorax can be related to delayed repolarization of a portion of the anterior wall of the heart . this finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that lower than normal right cardiac sympathetic activity is the main pathogenetic mechanism of lqts . multipeak distribution and high nondipolar content suggest regional electrical disparities in the ventricular recovery process . this may in part account for the high susceptibility of patients with lqts to malignant arrhythmias . 
endocardial catheter mapping : wire skeleton technique for representation of computed arrhythmogenic sites compared with intraoperative mapping . guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia by preoperative endocardial catheter mapping necessitates improvement of the accuracy of localization of the arrhythmogenic site . we therefore used a new mathematical cineradiographic method during catheter mapping to compute the position of left ventricular arrhythmogenic sites relative to three anatomic reference points : the centers of aortic and mitral valve ostia and the left ventricular apex . to enable the surgeon to identify the position of the computed sites , a wire skeleton ( one for each patient ) representing a single or multiple arrhythmogenic site ( s ) relative to the anatomic reference points was constructed . this wire skeleton was inserted into the left ventricular cavity during surgery . side branches of the device indicated preoperatively localized arrhythmogenic sites . results in eight consecutive patients were compared with those of intraoperative simultaneous mapping of 64 endocardial sites . sixteen morphologically distinct monomorphic ventricular tachycardias were mapped by catheter and 15 by intraoperative mapping . in 12 ventricular tachycardias an identical morphology was recorded during both techniques . the distance between arrhythmogenic sites localized with both methods was 1 cm or less in 11 of these 12 ventricular tachycardias and 2 cm in one ventricular tachycardia . these results indicate that endocardial catheter mapping combined with wire skeleton representation of computed positions of arrhythmogenic sites is reliable for guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia and since some of the ventricular tachycardias were inducible only during either preoperative or intraoperative mapping , both techniques have an additive value . in addition , the wire skeleton proved convenient during surgery by identifying the arrhythmogenic sites . 
effects of incremental doses of procainamide on ventricular refractoriness , intraventricular conduction , and induction of ventricular tachycardia . the short-term effects of incremental doses of procainamide ( 7.5 , 15 , 22.5 , and 30 mg / kg ) on right ventricular effective refractory period , intraventricular conduction , and induction of ventricular tachycardia were determined in 31 patients who had a history of sustained , unimorphic ventricular tachycardia . qrs duration during incremental ventricular pacing was used as an index of rate-dependent changes in intraventricular conduction . the mean plasma procainamide concentrations corresponding to the incremental doses were 5.5 + / - 1.2 ( + / - sd ) , 9.0 + / - 1.6 , 12.6 + / - 2.2 , and 16.3 + / - 3.2 mg / liter . each incremental dose of procainamide up to a dose of 30 mg / kg resulted in a significant increment in right ventricular effective refractory period and each dose up to 22.5 mg / kg potentiated a rate-dependent prolongation of qrs duration . after the 7.5 mg / kg dose of procainamide , induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in eight of 31 patients . after higher doses of procainamide , induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in two additional patients . in three of 10 patients in whom the induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by 7.5 , 15 , or 22.5 mg / kg of procainamide , sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after a higher dose of procainamide . in three of 31 patients , only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible after a 7.5 to 22.5 mg / kg dose of procainamide ; however , in two of these three patients , sustained ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after administration of a higher dose of procainamide . in conclusion , during electropharmacologic testing with procainamide , it is worthwhile to test a dose of 7.5 mg / kg , because this dose is often effective in patients who respond to this drug . however , the results of this study indicate that procainamide may be effective in suppressing the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia at a relatively low plasma concentration , but not at a higher plasma concentration . therefore , during long-term therapy with procainamide it may be important to avoid plasma procainamide concentrations not only lower , but also higher than the concentration that results in the suppression of induction of tachycardia . 
coronary angioplasty for early postinfarction unstable angina . coronary angioplasty was performed in 53 patients in whom unstable angina had reoccurred after 48 hr and within 30 days after sustained myocardial infarction . single-vessel disease was present in 64 % of the patients and multivessel disease in 36 % . the preceding myocardial infarction had been small to moderate in size in the majority of the patients . the left ventricular ejection fraction was more than 50 % in 80 % of the patients . forty-five patients were refractory to pharmacologic treatment ; eight were initially stabilized but once again became symptomatic with light exertion . angioplasty was performed in 35 patients 2 to 14 days and in 18 patients 15 to 30 days after infarction ( average 12 + / - 7 days after infarction ) . the initial success rate was 89 % ( 47 / 53 ) . the success rate of the patients treated at 2 to 14 days was lower ( 29 / 35 , 83 % ) than that of patients treated at 14 to 30 days ( 18 / 18 , 100 % ) but did not reach statistical significance ( p less than .06 ) . there were no deaths related to the procedure . in four of the six failures , emergency bypass surgery was performed and two patients sustained a myocardial infarction . furthermore , a myocardial infarction complicated the angioplasty procedure in two other patients ; thus the overall procedure-related myocardial infarction rate was 8 % ( 4 / 53 ) . at 6 months follow-up 26 % ( 14 / 53 ) of all the patients who underwent angioplasty had recurrence of angina , which was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty , bypass surgery , or medical therapy . there were no late deaths . late myocardial infarction occurred in two patients . thus the total myocardial infarction rate after angioplasty at 6 months was 11 % ( 6 / 53 patients ) .

coronary dissection and total coronary occlusion associated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty : significance of initial angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses . coronary dissection and total coronary occlusion leading to emergency coronary surgery are the most frequent complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) and their occurrence usually is unpredictable . to identify angiographic characteristics of coronary stenoses that may affect the incidence of these complications , the diagnostic pre-ptca coronary angiograms of 38 consecutive patients ( group i ) undergoing emergency coronary surgery for dissection or occlusion were reviewed and compared with the angiograms of a random sample of 38 patients ( stratified for left anterior descending and right coronary arteries ) from a group of 1151 who did not need emergency coronary surgery ( group ii ) . stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered " complicated " if at least one of the following criteria was present : irregular borders , intraluminal lucency , and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation . baseline characteristics , maximum inflation pressures , types of balloon catheters used , and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties ( severity , length , eccentricity , and calcification ) were similar in both groups . irregular borders before ptca were present in 22 of 38 patients in group i vs 10 of 38 in group ii ( p less than .05 ) , intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 ( p less than .05 ) , localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 ( p less than .05 ) , and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 ( ns ) . complicated angiographic morphology of coronary stenosis may represent a risk factor for dissection or occlusion . therefore , although the predictive value of these findings is low , detailed evaluation of angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses may improve patient selection and reduce complication rates of ptca . 
which patients benefit most from early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase ? [ published erratum appears in circulation 1987 feb ; 75 ( 2 ) : 394 ] the effect of thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction on enzymatic infarct size , left ventricular function , and early mortality was studied in subsets of patients in a randomized trial . early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase ( 152 patients ) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase ( 117 patients ) was compared with conventional treatment ( 264 patients ) . all 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hr after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction . four hundred eighty-eight patients were eligible for this detailed analysis , and 245 of these were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment . early angiographic examinations were performed in 212 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy . patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients ( 85 % ) . enzymatic infarct size , as measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release , was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy ( median 760 vs 1170 u / liter in control patients , p = .0001 ) . left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge from the hospital was higher after thrombolytic therapy ( median 50 % vs 43 % in control patients , p = .0001 ) . three month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy ( 6 % vs 14 % in the control group , p = .006 ) . with the use of multivariate regression analysis , infarct size limitation , improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction , and three month mortality were predicted by sum of the st segment elevation , time from onset of symptoms to admission , and killip class at admission . thrombolysis was most effective in patients admitted within 2 hr after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sum of st segment elevation of 1.2 mv or more . on the other hand , no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size , left ventricular function , or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with a sum of st segment elevation of less than 1.2 mv who were admitted between 2 and 4 hr after onset of symptoms . 
vest inflation without simultaneous ventilation during cardiac arrest in dogs : improved survival from prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation . myocardial and cerebral blood flow can be generated during cardiac arrest by techniques that manipulate intrathoracic pressure . augmentation of intrathoracic pressure by high-pressure ventilation simultaneous with compression of the chest in dogs has been shown to produce higher flows to the heart and brain , but has limited usefulness because of the requirement for endotracheal intubation and complex devices . a system was developed that can produce high intrathoracic pressure without simultaneous ventilation by use of a pneumatically cycled vest placed around the thorax ( vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ cpr ] ) . the system was first tested in a short-term study of the maximum achievable flows during arrest . peak vest pressures up to 380 mm hg were used on eight 21 to 30 kg dogs after induction of ventricular fibrillation and administration of epinephrine . microsphere-determined myocardial blood flow was 108 + / - 17 ml / min / 100 g ( 100 + / - 16 % of prearrest flow ) and cerebral flow was 51 + / - 12 ml / min / 100 g ( 165 + / - 39 % of prearrest ) . severe lung or liver trauma was noted in three of eight dogs . if peak vest pressure was limited to 280 mm hg , however , severe trauma was no longer observed . a study of the hemodynamics during and survival from prolonged resuscitation was then performed on three groups of seven dogs . vest cpr was compared with manual cpr with either conventional ( 300 newtons ) or high ( 430 newtons ) sternal force . after induction of ventricular fibrillation , each technique was performed for 26 min . defibrillation was then performed .

the immediate effects of iohexol on coronary blood flow and myocardial function in vivo . radiographic techniques used to quantify coronary blood flow all require bolus injection of contrast material , which markedly alters the flow being measured . newer nonionic contrast agents have been shown to have fewer adverse hemodynamic , inotropic , and rheologic effects compared with ionic media and it has been suggested that they might not substantially affect coronary blood flow . six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals . intracoronary injections of iohexol ( 300 mg / ml iodine ) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function . two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml / sec ; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml / sec . the 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31 % ( p less than .01 ) and 77 % ( p less than .001 ) . the 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml / sec 77 % ( p less than .001 ) and 69 % ( p less than .001 ) . the magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose , and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection . decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19 % to 29 % . the effects on regional myocardial function were independent of contrast volume . however , the degree of dysfunction was more profound with slower infusion rates , suggesting that prolongation of contrast-induced ischemia was a major modulating factor .

reduction in experimental infarct size by recombinant human superoxide dismutase : insights into the pathophysiology of reperfusion injury . to determine the importance of reperfusion injury and the ability of the free-radical scavenger recombinant human superoxide dismutase ( h-sod ) to prevent it , open-chest dogs underwent 90 min of proximal circumflex coronary artery occlusion , and only at the moment of reperfusion received either h-sod ( 400 , 000 iu bolus into the left atrium followed by a 300 , 000 iu iv infusion over 1 hr ) or saline . after 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region ( by postmortem angiography ) and infarct size ( by gross pathology ) . all measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given , and the code was broken only at the end of the study . hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups . infarct size in control animals ( n = 8 ) averaged 22.4 + / - 3.1 % of the left ventricle and 52.2 + / - 7.1 % of the risk region , compared with 13.3 + / - 0.8 % of the left ventricle and 33.6 + / - 2.1 % of the risk region in h-sod-treated dogs ( n = 8 ) ( p less than .05 ) . infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller , but also exhibited a distinctive " patchiness , " suggesting protection along vascular distributions . furthermore , analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-sod was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows . this study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage , presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow . since the h-sod preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia , scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium . 
magnetic resonance imaging of acute myocardial infarction : gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid as a marker of reperfusion . we examined the effects of a paramagnetic contrast agent , gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ( gd-dtpa ) on magnetic resonance images of acute myocardial infarction with and without reperfusion . twenty-two dogs underwent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery ( lad ) . in 10 dogs ( group i ) the lad remained occluded for 3 hr and in the other 12 ( group ii ) for 2 hr followed by 1 hr of reperfusion . gd-dtpa ( 0.34 mm / kg ) was administered to five dogs in group i at 2 hr and 5 min after occlusion and to seven dogs in group ii 5 min after reperfusion . at 3 hr after ligation , the hearts were excised and imaged with spin echo and inversion recovery pulse sequences on a 0.35 tesla magnetic resonance imager . reperfused hearts given gd-dtpa demonstrated a significant increase in contrast between normal and reperfused myocardium as compared with nonreperfused hearts and reperfused hearts not given gd-dtpa . this enhancement was particularly prominent in the inversion recovery images . studies performed in vivo in two additional dogs demonstrated similar enhancement with reperfusion with gd-dtpa in gated spin echo images . contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allows the detection of reperfusion early in the course of acute infarction . 
dietary guidelines for healthy american adults . a statement for physicians and health professionals by the nutrition committee , american heart association . this statement for physicians replaces the american heart association 's diet and coronary heart disease , published in 1978. the current guidelines propose an optimal preventive diet for coronary heart disease . emphasis is placed on the reduction of both saturated fat and total fat . complex carbohydrates are recommended as the major replacement for calories from fat . polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats partially replace calories from other fat sources . cholesterol and sodium guidelines are expressed relative to caloric intake , with an upper limit on each . the use of alcohol as a possible means of preventing cardiovascular disease is not advised . maintenance of ideal body weight by calorie control and an adequate level of activity is emphasized . 
proceedings of the 1985 national conference on standards and guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiac care . july 11-13 , dallas , texas . 
a needs assessment of advanced life support and emergency medical services in the pediatric patient : state of the art . the outcome from cardiopulmonary arrest in children in the prehospital and hospital setting is generally poor . the event that compromises the cardiac status is often respiratory embarrassment , and the presenting rhythms are often bradyarrhythmias and asystole . emergency medical services ( ems ) systems have primarily an adult focus and may not be organized to manage optimally the critically ill and injured child . data from a survey of training programs demonstrate that paramedic and emt education in pediatric emergencies may be inadequate . forty-one percent of the programs surveyed had less than 10 hr of pediatric training . data suggest that ems providers may not be equipped to manage children effectively . the los angeles ems system for children is described . there are two levels of receiving facilities : emergency departments approved for pediatrics and pediatric critical care centers . the system is voluntary and has 85 % of the hospitals in compliance with the guidelines . early recognition of the prearrest state , improved training , and equipping of prehospital care personnel , development of ems services for children , dissemination of an advanced pediatric life support course , as well as research in pediatric cpr may improve the outcome of resuscitation in the pediatric population . 
special considerations for defibrillation performed by emergency medical technicians in small communities . defibrillation by minimally trained ambulance technicians can significantly improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in communities of all sizes . however , special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities , chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls . communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician ( emt-d ) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and , if inadequate , alter their system of ambulance response . after implementation of such a program , a permanent , formal skill maintenance program must be established . defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion , yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available . finally , every community instituting an emt-d program must maintain a system of monitoring emt performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program . for smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs . 
education and evaluation in emergency cardiac care programs ( cpr and advanced cardiac life support ) : state of the art . to increase the survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , improvements in training must be made so that lay rescuers are motivated and have the ability to get involved . to overcome some of the fear and lack of involvement , better education strategies are needed . adults learn didactic information through understanding and skills through repetition and reinforcement . due to the fact that there is limited time that adults will commit to learning cpr , methods of simplification of the techniques need to be used so that there can be sufficient repetition and reinforcement . teaching two-rescuer cpr to lay rescuers should not routinely be done . most adults , particularly those around high-risk individuals , should learn one-rescuer cpr . infant resuscitation should be taught predominantly to those around small children . methods of reinforcement through the mass media should be attempted on a routine basis . whenever possible the courses should be spread over a period of time to allow for repetition and reinforcement , thereby maximizing learning . advanced cardiac life support ( acls ) should be widely taught to health professionals . acls instruction needs to be spread over time , whenever logistically possible , to enhance learning and retention . good , validated examinations are needed and should be routinely rotated . better methods of evaluation are needed to look at the benefit of these types of programs and to improve the cost-benefit ratio . 
near drowning . several conditions that contribute to drowning and near drowning must be considered in the treatment of near-drowned victims . regardless of the cause , mechanical ventilation should begin as soon as possible and closed-chest cardiac massage should be administered when there is any question about the adequacy of cardiac output . after aspiration of either fresh or seawater , a large intrapulmonary physiologic shunt can occur , which requires aggressive mechanical ventilatory support to ensure adequate oxygenation and to return pulmonary function to normal . near drowning is a multisystem disease and , while abnormalities of the lung and brain have been emphasized , definitive therapy must be tailored to each patient and must address all of the patient 's needs . 
emergency medical service systems in acute cardiac care : state of the art . over the last two decades , emergency medical services in the united states have been greatly improved . organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients , particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient . in seattle as many as 40 % of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics . although these systems are growing and improving health care , many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement . emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities . it has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred : time to starting any of the rescue procedures , use of electrical defibrillation when indicated , use of epinephrine , and adequacy of the technique of basic life support , particularly the ventilation component . to provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time , defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit . with the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators , first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims . the use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics , however , must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained . 
modifications of cardiopulmonary resuscitation based on the cough . the ability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) to provide adequate vital organ blood flow during prolonged resuscitation has long been questioned , as has the mechanism of blood flow during cpr . because coughing during cardiac arrest has been shown to produce adequate anterograde flow to maintain consciousness in man without compressing the heart , cough cpr has been used as a model of a pure " thoracic pump " mechanism on which to base modifications of cpr . in the thoracic pump mechanism , the left heart is a passive conduit for blood expressed from the pulmonary vasculature to the aorta , and there is selective flow to the brachiocephalic vascular bed because of its low pressure veins , which are protected by closure of thoracic inlet venous valves . right heart flow from systemic veins to the lungs occurs between applications of pressure . four alternative modalities exploiting the thoracic pump concept were studied in dogs during ventricular fibrillation with angiographic and pressure recordings : cough cpr , simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation , abdominal compression with lung inflation , and inflation of a vest and binder . the latter technique was associated with successful defibrillation and recovery after more than 30 min of circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation . preliminary studies in a primate preparation indicate that this technique might be useful for prolonged circulatory support in man when defibrillation is not initially available or successful . 
the influence of manual chest compression rate on hemodynamic support during cardiac arrest : high-impulse cardiopulmonary resuscitation . considerable effort has been expended in recent years by a number of laboratories to improve methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation . this article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage . in most studies , long-term canine preparations were used , and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements . although cardiac output was depressed with all cpr methods , manual chest compressions of high velocity , moderate force , and brief duration at a rate of 120 / min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow . this method was termed high-impulse cpr . high-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting , and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man . based on this experience , it is suggested that the american heart association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120 / min during closed-chest cardiac massage . 
foreign body airway obstruction : considerations in 1985. management of foreign body airway obstruction continues to be a major controversy in emergency medical care . much of the disagreement is without doubt based on lack of a uniformly accepted model of acute airway obstruction representative of the clinical event . a variety of models have been used to assess different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies . these models have analyzed , among other variables , kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy . human volunteers , anesthetized and paralyzed patients , and cadavers have also been used . in several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice , while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient 's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction . it seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected . 
alternative methods of ventilation during respiratory and cardiac arrest . artificial ventilation is a cornerstone of basic life support-cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( bls-cpr ) . recent data corroborate clinical studies performed in the 1950s and 1960s , suggesting a need to change the present american heart association standards for artificial ventilation . these studies show that gastric insufflation followed by regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration are a major hazard of artificial ventilation with an unprotected airway . present bls-cpr standards require that ventilation be performed rapidly between external chest compressions or with incremental breaths . these methods of ventilation predispose the victim to gastric insufflation . alternative methods of ventilation with longer inspiratory time and thus lower flow rate and peak inspiratory pressure are suggested . additionally , rescue personnel , particularly emts and paramedics , should be taught how to apply cricoid pressure to prevent gastric insufflation in victims with an unprotected airway . 
failure of sodium bicarbonate to improve resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation in dogs . to determine the value of sodium bicarbonate in resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation and the prevention of spontaneous refibrillation , sodium bicarbonate ( 1 meq / kg ) or placebo was administered on a random basis to 16 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs 18 min after the induction of ventricular fibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation . defibrillation was attempted 2 min after the administration of bicarbonate or placebo . all animals were successfully defibrillated , but three of eight bicarbonate-treated and two of eight control animals died in electromechanical dissociation ( p = ns ) . spontaneous refibrillation occurred in three animals in each group ( p = ns ) . successful resuscitation was not dependent on treatment , arterial or mixed venous pco2 , or arterial or mixed venous ph but correlated strongly with coronary perfusion pressure ( p less than .003 ) . spontaneous refibrillation occurred without relation to any identifiable variable . the gradient between diastolic aortic and right atrial pressures was 24 + / - 2 mm hg in controls and 23 + / - 2 mm hg in treated animals over the entire 20 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( p = ns ) . however , among animals successfully resuscitated , mean diastolic coronary perfusion pressure averaged 27 + / - 2 mm hg compared with 20 + / - 1 mm hg among those dying in electromechanical dissociation ( p less than .02 ) . for the final 2 min of resuscitation , after drug administration , these gradients were 31 + / - 2 and 23 + / - 2 mm hg , respectively ( p less than .01 ) . microsphere determined myocardial perfusion correlated with the diastolic aortic-right atrial perfusion pressure gradient ( r = .86 ) and was 0.43 + / - 0.03 ml / min / g in survivors and 0.22 + / - 0.01 ml / min / g in nonsurvivors ( p less than .01 ) .

defibrillation performed by the emergency medical technician . as a means of providing defibrillation as soon as possible for those suffering out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation , numerous communities have trained and authorized emergency medical technicians ( emts ) to provide defibrillatory shocks ( emt-d ) . the findings of four controlled studies and the experience of various communities have answered important questions . emt-d programs have been shown effective in urban , suburban , and rural communities with and without paramedic backup . emt-d programs appear safe , with errors of commission being extremely rare and errors of omission being of acceptably low incidence . issues still to be resolved include the degree and amount of training that should be given and whether manual or automatic defibrillators should be used . medical supervision and quality control is the most important aspect of emt-d programs . at its core , the success of emt-d programs is confirmation of the principle of early defibrillation . wider dissemination of early defibrillation will improve survival from sudden cardiac death .

computed tomography : a mandatory investigational procedure for the t-staging of advanced laryngeal cancer . eighteen patients underwent computed tomography ( ct ) prior to total laryngectomy . in order to assess the accuracy of ct scanning in the evaluation of carcinoma of the larynx , ct scans were prospectively interpreted and the extent of the tumour was recorded . the tumour extent was evaluated on whole-mount histologic sections of the laryngeal specimens , prepared in the horizontal plane , similar to the ct scan . the results were compared to assess the ability of ct to identify tumour infiltration in the horizontal plane accurately . based on these findings it is clear that ct has its influence on the t-staging and on the choice of treatment of laryngeal cancer , i.e. radiotherapy versus surgery . 
children 's sore throats related to parental smoking . there has been concern that the smoking of tobacco can adversely affect the health of non-smokers . this is most cogent in children who are subject to smoke at home . the aim of this study is to relate children 's sore throats to the smoking habits of their parents . the parents of 154 children were asked about the age , sex , birthweight , method of postnatal feeding and age at starting school or day nursery of the child , the frequency of sore throats , smoking habits and history of tonsillectomy of all members of the household , the size of family , the dwelling size , and the occupation of the father . analysis by multiple regression showed a significant association between children 's sore throats and maternal smoking . reduction in domestic cigarette smoke exposure should benefit the child by reducing the number of sore throats he or she suffers . 
bacteriological aspects of swimming with grommets . a prospective bacteriological and symptomatic study was carried out on 50 swimmers and 50 non-swimmers who had grommets inserted for secretory otitis media . the risk of developing otorrhoea with positive bacterial pathogens was similar for swimmers ( 7.9 % ) and non-swimmers ( 8.0 % ) . subdividing the non-swimmers into ' wetters ' and ' strictly dry ' there was a similar risk of ear symptoms and pathogens . all children who swim before the insertion of grommets should continue to do so postoperatively with no added risk of ear infections . 
a non-invasive method of demonstrating the nasal cycle using flexible liquid crystal thermography . the relationship between air flow at 38 degrees c and area colour change on a flexible liquid crystal film was found to be virtually linear between the values of 1 and 31 min-1 cm-2 . this value of flow per unit area corresponded to values expected at the level of the nostril during quiet breathing . a series of 6 subjects were asked to breathe over a flexible liquid crystal film regularly during the day and the area of colour change produced by flow from each nostril was examined . four subjects showed a regular change in relative flow through each nostril whilst 2 subjects showed a constant flow through each nostril . this simple and non-invasive technique provides a method of examining the nasal cycle in adults and children in health and disease . 
video time-lapse microscopy of human laryngeal carcinomas in vitro . twelve human laryngeal carcinomas and 14 normal vocal cord epithelia were studied in vitro by the method of tissue culture incorporating video time-lapse microscopy . different events were photographed by taking ' stills ' from the television monitor during play-back . outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers . mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth . some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance . this was more prevalent in the tumour cultures . in both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell . these lymphocytes appear to represent t-suppressor cells . the present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma . the interaction between mitotic tumour cells and lymphocytes may represent a transformation of t-lymphocytes into lak cells . 
hypertetraploid cells in vocal cord epithelia . dna measurements yield information about the nature of cells and may provide diagnostic and prognostic information . static cytofluorometry was performed on smears removed at microlaryngoscopy from 107 vocal cord lesions ( 96 patients ) . all stem cell lines were diploid except 3 ; 2 carcinomas and 1 severe dysplasia were polyploid . the mean proliferative activity ( percentage of nuclei greater than diploid peak ) was 2.1 % for the group of epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia , 3.1 % for those with moderate dysplasia , 4.0 % for severe dysplasia , and 6.8 % for carcinomas . hypertetraploid cell nuclei ( ht cells ) were not found in epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia . seven out of 15 patients with epithelia showing moderate dysplasia had ht cells ; 5 of these patients developed a carcinoma . one of 8 without ht cells developed a severe dysplasia . nine patients with severe dysplasia had ht cells ; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years . in 14 patients without ht cells , 3 had recurrences and 1 developed a carcinoma 6 years later . ht cells were found in 15 patients with t1 & t2 carcinomas ; residual carcinoma was present in 2 after radiotherapy and 4 had recurrences within 11 months . fourteen patients with t1 & t2 carcinoma did not have any ht cells ; one had residual carcinoma after radiotherapy and 3 had recurrences between 18 months and 4 years . dna measurements and , especially , the demonstration of epithelia with ht cells prove to be of prognostic importance .

the patterson operation for decompression of the orbit . a modification of patterson 's external antro-ethmoidectomy operation is described which provides a more direct and simpler approach than the transantral operation for decompression of the orbit . 
transection of varicose vessels in the nasal mucosa of patients with recurrent epistaxis . a 2-year follow-up . twenty-two patients with recurrent nose bleeds and varicose vessels on the nasal septum were subjected to transection of the vessels and followed-up for 2 years . one month after the operation , it was not possible to identify the original vessels . in other locations new varicose vessels began to appear after 1 month , and at the end of the follow-up period were observed on 9 out of 10 operated sides . the transection resulted in an immediate decrease in the frequency of nose bleeds and at the end of the control period 12 ( 55 % ) of the patients had had less than 4 bleeds during the previous year in spite of the observed rapid formation of new vessels . mucosal atrophy with symptoms of increased nasal crusting occurred in 3 patients . transection of varicose vessels in patients with nose bleeds leads to a decrease in the number of bleeds . 
autonomic microganglia of the nasal mucosa and their relation to vasomotor rhinitis . the classical concept of the autonomic innervation of the nasal mucosa states that the postganglionic sympathetic neurones lie in the superior cervical ganglion and those of the postganglionic parasympathetic neurones are in the pterygopalatine ganglion . we have carried out a study of the fine structure of the respiratory nasal mucosa in man and in the cat using the techniques described by jabonero , champy maillet and koelle-friedenwald . the most striking finding was the presence of microganglia deep within the mucosa of the inferior turbinate close to the glands . these microganglia were cholinergic in nature since they demonstrated a positive reaction to anticholinesterase . from this we deduce that the nasal parasympathetic pathway has its postganglionic neurones not only in the pterygopalatine ganglion but also in these microganglia of the inferior turbinate . each of four groups of cats were submitted to different techniques , including administration of neostigmine , inferior turbinectomy and vidian neurectomy . resection of the microganglia by means of turbinectomy reduced the hypersecretion caused by neostigmine and this was most noticeable when a vidian neurectomy was carried out in addition .

triamterene-induced crystalluria and cylinduria : clinical and experimental studies . we examined the occurrence of crystals and casts in the urine of healthy subjects after administration of triamterene and the site of crystal formation in experimental animals . twenty out of twenty healthy subjects had abundant triamterene crystals and casts in acid urine after receiving a single 100 mg dose . casts were present in the urine from 2-11 hours after administration of the diuretic . cast formation occurred in acidic urine and was prevented by alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate . animal studies showed that crystallization and cast formation occurred in the medullary and papillary collecting ducts of the rat kidney . these findings provide a possible explanation for the reported nephrotoxicity of triamterene , particularly when given to patients who are receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents . 
percutaneous renal biopsy in infants and young children . records of 55 percutaneous renal biopsies performed in 53 children aged 5 days to two years were reviewed . radiographic or ultrasound imaging techniques were not utilized during the biopsy procedure . forty-nine of 55 biopsy attempts yielded sufficient tissue for histologic evaluation ( 89.1 % ) . transient gross hematuria not requiring intervention was the sole complication and was noted in 6 of 55 biopsy attempts ( 10.9 % ) . percutaneous renal biopsy can be performed safely in very young children and the success of the procedure is comparable to that in older children . 
intraperitoneal fibrin-formation and its inhibition in capd . the intraperitoneal fibrin formation and its inhibition by intraperitoneal heparin ( 5000 u ) was investigated in six patients on capd . the intraperitoneal heparin concentration decreased linearily from 1.78 u / ml to 1.13 u / ml during a 4-hour dwell time . the antithrombin iii-concentration increased to 0.56 + / - 0.1 mg / dl , reaching 1.87 % of normal plasma values . the antithrombin iii-portion of total protein was 0.62 % in plasma and 0.79 % in dialysate . the fibrinopeptide a-concentration , a specific product of thrombin action on fibrinogen was 37.1 + / - 11.8 ng / ml in plasma ( normal range : less than 2.5 ng / ml ) and 153.4 + / - 16.8 ng / ml in dialysate during regular capd . after the addition of 5000 u heparin the fibrinopeptide a-concentration in dialysate decreased to 11.6 + / - 2.6 ng / ml during a 4-hour dwell time . in vitro experiments showed no remarkable inhibition of fibrin formation by heparin without antithrombin iii in dialysate . we suggest that the fibrinopeptide a is produced intraperitoneally and the antithrombin iii-concentration in dialysate is sufficient to inhibit the fibrin formation after acceleration by heparin . 
reversible membranous glomerulonephritis associated with ketoprofen . an 87-year-old woman presented with the nephrotic syndrome 12 months after administration of ketoprofen , 100 mg daily for osteoarthritis . clinical course and laboratory data were consistent with drug-induced nephropathy . kidney biopsy showed membranous glomerulonephritis . evolution was favorable with resolution of proteinuria after drug withdrawal and steroid administration . a review of the literature on nephrotic syndrome associated with nsaid reveals membranous glomerulonephritis to be an unusual complication . 
osteoid osteoma in a cervical pedicle . resection via transpillar approach . lesions in the pedicles of the cervical spine are both a diagnostic and technical challenge . an osteoid osteoma of the pedicle of the fourth cervical vertebra occurred in a 17-year-old girl . resection of the tumor adjacent to the dura medially and the vertebral artery anterolaterally was accomplished via a transpillar approach . the transosseus approach preserved the facet joints and posterior elements and obviated the need for an interbody fusion . 
upper extremity proprioception in idiopathic scoliosis . twenty-three patients with idiopathic scoliosis were tested for upper extremity proprioceptive function . all subjects had documented progression of deformity , with an average curvature of 34 degrees . the average ages for scoliotics and 18 control subjects were 16.1 and 20.8 years , respectively . controls had no spinal deformity and underwent identical test procedures . the test results showed that scoliotic subjects had significant asymmetry between right and left limbs in their threshold for detection of joint motion ( p less than or equal to 0.005 ) and in their ability to reproduce angles to which their elbow joint had been previously positioned ( p less than or equal to 0.025 ) . slight asymmetry also was observed in the reproduction tests of the control group ( p less than or equal to 0.013 ) ; however , there was no significant asymmetry seen in this group for the threshold test . performance of bilateral limbs was designated good and bad for both groups ; the limb that performed better in proprioceptive function was designated good limb . analysis of data showed that the scoliotics ' good and bad limbs performed inferiorly in both threshold and angle reproduction tests when compared with normal controls . the results of this study imply , but do not localize , a neurologic deficit in scoliotic patients . 
a new approach to the treatment of ankle fractures . the inyo nail . the inyo nail is a new intramedullary device for the treatment of fractures of the distal fibula . it is a tapered v-shaped nail made of malleable stainless steel , which provides rigid fracture fixation . torsional stress is resisted because of its triflanged shape . it may be introduced closed , using the image intensifier . two groups of patients were evaluated : group i was treated with the inyo nail and group ii was treated by the association for the study of internal fixation ( asif ) technique . eighty-five percent of the patients in group i were rated as good , compared with 63 % in group ii . there was significantly less morbidity and complications in group i . several factors must be observed in the treatment of ankle fractures . stress radiographs must be obtained intraoperative . surgery may be indicated in unstable supination lateral rotation type ii injuries , if these occur in patients with high physical demands . anatomic reduction of the lateral malleolus must be obtained . early weight-bearing and motion produces the best result . late reconstruction of malunions can be accomplished using the inyo nail . 
nonoperative management of isolated grade iii collateral ligament injury in high school football players . in a prospective study , 24 high school football players with isolated grade iii injuries of the medial collateral ligament ( mcl ) of the knee were treated by conservative management . this included an active rehabilitation program , progressing from immobilization and controlled motion in an orthotic rehabilitation knee brace , to muscle strengthening and agility exercise . a stable knee was achieved in 22 cases ; the average recovery time was 29 days . the athletes returned to competitive sports at a mean time of 34 days . these results confirm previous reports of successful nonoperative management of isolated grade iii mcl injuries . 
tibial component fixation in knee arthroplasty . using roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis ( rsa ) , the integrity of the bond between the tibial component and the tibia was studied in seven knees , implanted with a cemented kinematic total knee prosthesis for gonarthrosis . migration ranging from 0.3 to 1.9 mm over a two-year period occurred in all seven cases . displacement , induced by external forces , ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mm was observed in five cases . measurable migration and inducible displacement may be the rule rather than an exception in total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) . accordingly , absolute rigid fixation would not be necessary for successful function of a tka . 
ruptures of the extensor mechanism of the knee joint . clinical results and patellofemoral articulation . the functional results of 28 cases of rupture of the quadriceps and patellar tendons are reported . excellent or good results were noted in 15 of 18 quadriceps and 7 of 10 patellar tendons . radiographic comparison with the opposite knee disclosed incongruences between the patella and the femoral groove in the tangential view and / or cranial-caudal position of the patella in the lateral view in 13 of the quadriceps tendon ruptures and seven of the patellar tendon ruptures . patients with residual pain had patellofemoral incongruity but since two-thirds of the patients with incongruity were asymptomatic , incongruity alone may not be the cause of the symptoms . there was no positive correlation to muscular strength or range of movement . nevertheless , exact adaptation of the patellar tendon and periarticular tissue seems necessary to obtain correct patello-femoral articulation . reinforcement of the tendon with a wire cerclage is recommended to decrease the tension on the suture line and the consequent risk of a secondary rupture . in acute ruptures of the quadriceps tendon end-to-end sutures are sufficient . 
a modified technique for anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) surgery using a new drill guide for isometric positioning of the acl . in reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) it is important to place the inner ends of the drill channels correctly , to get the acl into an isometric position . anatomic studies demonstrate the value of a modified surgical technique using a special drill guide for standardized positioning of the anterior cruciate substitute . the drill guide consists of a metal frame with one adjustable and one fixed guide tube . drilling is done from the anteromedial aspect of the tibia , upwards , through the joint space and the femur in a straight line , both channels being drilled in a single procedure . the precision of guided drilling was superior to that of free-hand drilling in positioning the ligament in the correct anatomic place . 
patella alta and the adolescent growth spurt . the presence of patella alta has been linked to recurrent dislocation of the patella and the patello-femoral stress syndrome . it is not known whether patella alta is an inherited or acquired trait . to investigate the relationship of patella during the adolescent growth spurt , serial orthoroentgenograms ( growth study films ) were retrospectively analyzed in 19 patients . two were found in whom proximal patella migration could be correlated ( r = 0.85 ) with femoral growth rate . this was significant at the p = 0.01 level . girls had a higher correlation of patella height to growth rate than boys . in certain cases , patella alta is an acquired rather than inherited condition ; this supports the theory that overgrowth during the growth spurt can lead to patella alta in some individuals . 
accurate interpretation of the lachman test . in a consecutive series of patients with knee complaints , tibial rotation consistently affected the interpretation of the lachman test ( passive anterior tibial translation in slight knee flexion ) . to perform the lachman test correctly , the anterior tibial force must be applied posteromedially on the proximal tibia . this is best achieved by having the leg under examination on the same side of the bed as the examiner , and with slight external tibial rotation . reaching across the bed to examine either leg can create either false positive or false negative lachman results due to inadvertent tibial rotation ( internal tibial rotation decreases translation ) and inaccurate comparisons of the injured and normal legs . the importance of tibial rotation must be recognized if the lachman test is to be used reliably and with maximum sensitivity . 
medial tibial pain . a prospective study of its cause among military recruits . in a prospective study of 295 infantry recruits during 14 weeks of basic training , 41 % had medial tibial pain . routine scintigraphic evaluation in cases of medial tibial bone pain showed that 63 % had abnormalities . a stress fracture was found in 46 % . only two patients had periostitis . none had ischemic medial compartment syndrome . physical examination could not differentiate between cases with medial tibial bone pain secondary to stress fractures and those with scintigraphically normal tibias . when both pain and swelling were localized in the middle one-third of the tibia , the lesion most likely proved to be a stress fracture . 
intraarticular methylprednisolone acetate in knee arthrotomy . ninety-eight arthrotomy patients undergoing meniscectomy were given intraoperative intraarticular methylprednisolone ( 40 mg ) or placebo using double-blind technique and were evaluated clinically at three days , two weeks , four weeks , eight weeks , and twelve weeks after operation . patients who received methylprednisolone showed small but statistically significant accelerated rehabilitation time with respect to subjectively evaluated pain and range of motion , through two weeks after operation . after two weeks , there was no further advantage over placebo through 12 weeks of rehabilitation . 
tibial torsion in patients with medial-type osteoarthritic knee . computed tomography measurements of tibial torsion were evaluated in 85 patients with medial-type osteoarthritic knees and in 24 normal adults . although there were no differences in the degrees of femoral torsion or knee joint rotation , external tibial torsion was observed to have a mean value of 11.3 degrees , significantly smaller than the 23.5 degrees observed in the normal adults ( p less than 0.01 ) . the more advanced the osteoarthritic stage , the greater was the reduction in external tibial torsion . reduction of external torsion of the tibia was most severe at the proximal tibial metaphysis . 
ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures . report of two cases using an alternate technique . a technique for ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fracture using the sliding compression hip screw with plate combined with trochanteric antegrade ender nailing of the femur was applied in two cases . ender nails can be passed without difficulty past a compression hip screw and the bicortical plating screws . the hip and femur can be fixed internally through a single approach in a single position . sliding compression hip screw devices can provide excellent preliminary stable femoral neck fixation . blood supply to the femoral head is not disturbed while the femoral intramedullary fixation is performed . antegrade ender nailing avoids the common knee complications associated with other retrograde techniques . decreased operative time , less blood loss , less technical difficulty , and early mobilization are important factors in the multiple-injured patient . femoral intramedullary fixation may require open reduction , circlerage to ensure stability , and maintenance of alignment in case of significant comminution to allow early crutch ambulation . this mode of fixation may be advantageous for selected cases . 
14-year follow-up study of a patient with massive calcar resorption . a case report . the authors present an in-depth clinical , radiographic , and pathologic analysis of a 62-year-old man with massive bone reabsorption around the proximal femur in a total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) . the tha was revised 13 years after implantation . thirty millimeters of calcar resorption was noted radiographically . evidence of stem bending was present on examination of the femoral implant , and marked wear of the acetabular cup was noted . the pathologic evaluation of removed calcar bone and cement revealed a histiocytic mass invading the bone . intracellular and extracellular polymethylene debris was noted within the invasive mass . evidence of fragmented methylmethacrylate cement was also present . the bone-cement interface in the excised calcar region contained segments that showed active bone remodelling around the cement without an interposed membrane . it is possible that this case of calcar resorption began with histiocytic activation and recruitment by polyethylene wear debris followed by active bone lysis . the process may be perpetuated by the fragmentation of cement , as motion occurred at the calcar bone-cement interface , and may represent an extreme example of a process occurring in cases of calcar resorption in general . 
closed percutaneous drilling for osteochondritis dissecans of the talus . a report of two cases . two cases of osteochondritis dissecans of the talar dome treated by closed percutaneous drilling are presented to illustrate a procedure for high-risk patients . the operation is performed with the aid of an image intensifier . the ostoechondral fragment is percutaneously drilled to avoid open operation and osteotomizing the medial malleolus . 
etiology of osteoarthritis of the hip . more than 90 % of patients with so-called primary or idiopathic osteoarthritis of the hips in whom sufficient data were available to make an assessment of the normality of the hip joint at the cessation of growth clearly showed demonstrable abnormalities in the hip joint . the most common are mild acetabular dysplasia and / or pistol grip deformity . this latter deformity is associated with mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis ( recognized or unrecognized at the time ) , legg-perthes ' disease ( recognized or unrecognized at the time ) , multiple epiphyseal dysplasia , spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia , and / or the presence of an intraacetabular labrum , as well as , in certain instances , acetabular dysplasia . when these abnormalities are taken in conjunction with the detection of other metabolic abnormalities that can lead to osteoarthritis of the hip and which may not be recognized readily , such as hemochromatosis , ochronosis , calcium pyrophosphate disease , and monarticular rheumatoid arthritis , it seems clear that either osteoarthritis of the hip does not exist at all as a primary disease entity or , if it does , is extraordinarily rare . 
fracture dislocation of the calcaneus . a report of two cases . in two typical cases of calcaneal fracture dislocation , the primary fracture , which runs forward and medially from a point behind the sustentaculum tali , is associated with inversion of the hindfoot . the calcaneus splits into a small anteromedial and a larger posterolateral fragment . rupture of the lateral collateral ligament allows the posterolateral calcaneal fragment to move laterally to lie immediately subjacent to the distal fibula . closed reduction is impossible . open reduction of this rare fracture dislocation is essential . a lateral approach to the calcaneus is generally sufficient , but a second medial incision may be required . 
radioulnar synostosis following an isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft . a case report . in the case of a 19-year-old man , overuse of his nondominant forearm resulted in a radioulnar synostosis . despite the persistence of the synostosis , the patient adapted to loss of forearm rotation . no further treatment was necessary . isolated fractures of the ulnar shaft are slow in healing . several authors observed that early function may be beneficial . however , excessive activity causing motion at the fracture site may cause subperiosteal hemorrhage and soft tissue trauma and may stimulate exuberant callus formation . fractures of the ulnar shaft , even undisplaced , need to be immobilized to prevent overuse . 
facet joint degeneration as a cause of low back pain . recognizing that not all patients with low back pain have lumbar disc disease , the authors began to inject facet joints in june 1982 and have experience now with 21 patients , each injected under fluoroscopic control with a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid . one technical problem occurred when large osteophytes blocked access to the facet joints . otherwise , there were no complications and minimal morbidity . most patients ( 15 of 20 ; 75 % ) had an initial response , but a much smaller number ( six of 18 followed more than three months ; 33 % ) had a lasting response . repeat injections , when done , always led to temporary improvement but rarely to lasting relief ( one of five ; 20 % ) . three factors characterized the patients : a negative screening examination for other causes of back pain or sciatica ; back pain with tenderness localized over one or more facet joints ; and radiologic changes of degenerative joint disease within the facet joints . facet joint disease may be a significant cause of low back pain . the above three criteria are useful in clinical identification of patients with this problem . facet joint injections play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain . 
the effects of chymopapain on prolapsed human intervertebral disc . a clinical and correlative histochemical study . light and electron microscopy were used to demonstrate extensive matrix degradation in a failed chymopapain-treated disc as compared with an untreated degenerative control disc . both specimens contained viable cells with patches of degenerative cells . there was a loss of disc height in the chymopapain-treated disc , but no improvement of symptoms . these results illustrated that even in well-circumscribed cases with documented disc protrusion into the spinal canal , the disc space narrowing following injection may aggravate the symptoms of nerve root entrapment , especially if a low-grade lateral recess stenosis is associated with the disc protrusion . the persistence or aggravation of symptoms probably is related to these anatomic considerations . the low level of enzyme activity in the injected area may or may not be correlated with the clinical response to treatment . 
stress fracture of the vertebral arch in osteopetrosis . stress fracture of the fourth vertebral arch occurred in a 21-year-old woman with a benign osteopetrosis . the fracture healed in three months after application of a body cast . it seems likely that the osteopetrotic bone resists force , in parallel with the cortical layer , but is fragile to forces at right angles to the plane of the cortical layer . 
the management of tibial fractures in acute spinal cord injury patients . of 34 tibia fractures in 28 acute spinal cord injuries , 13 patients had complete and 15 had incomplete neurologic lesions . tibia fractures were divided into three groups : group i , nonoperative treatment ; group ii , early open reduction and internal fixation ; and group iii , type iii open injuries . group i included 17 fractures , of which nine ( 53 % ) had delayed union , malunion , or nonunion . the average time to union was 6.5 months . seven patients had pressure sores and pulmonary emboli . eleven fractures were noted in group ii . one delayed union ( 9 % ) , one superficial wound infection that healed uneventfully , and one deep vein thrombosis were noted . the average time to union was 12 weeks . all six group iii tibias had delayed and nonunions , regardless of treatment . nonoperative fractures healed at a prolonged rate , while open reduction and internal fixation enhanced the rate and time to union . fractures treated with early open reduction and internal fixation , excluding group iii patients , had the least orthopedic and medical complications . open reduction and internal fixation is a justifiable alternative to nonoperative treatment in the uncomplicated tibia fracture regardless of neurologic lesion for improved medical and fracture care . 
the maquet procedure--anterior displacement of the tibial tubercle . indications , contraindications , and precautions . maquet recommended 2-2.5 cm of anterior tibial tubercle elevation for patients with symptomatic osteoarthrosis of the patellofemoral joint . fifty-three patients with osteoarthrosis were divided into three groups . the first 12 patients were treated by the classical maquet procedure ; 11 were totally relieved of patellofemoral pain , but there was one failure and five complications . in the second group of 32 patients , the patella was realigned within its groove to alter tracking of the patella to the proximal femoral condyles when necessary . fish-mouthing technique and insertion of a drain after surgery were done . after a two-year follow-up examination , there were two failures and five complications . a third group of nine patients was treated with ferguson 's modification of maquet 's operation using a 1.25-cm tibial tubercle elevation through a transverse incision ; two of the nine had complications , subsequently treated successfully by converting ferguson 's operation into the maquet operation , as modified for group ii . the modified maquet procedure can be an effective and reliable treatment of patellofemoral arthrosis with a relatively low incidence of complications . 
bilateral simultaneous achilles tendon ruptures . a case report and review of the literature . bilateral simultaneous achilles tendon ruptures are rare , with only ten cases reported in the english literature . our case is that of a 44-year-old woman , along with a review of the literature . affected persons usually are on chronic steroid treatment and in the fifth to seventh decades of life . the patient may have concomitant systemic disease , and the injury occurs with relatively mild trauma . the goals of treatment are mainly preventative , i.e. , cessation of steroids as soon as possible and protective bracing of the remaining intact achilles tendon . 
mineralization in in vitro cultures of rabbit marrow stromal cells . localized regions of mineralization were found in confluent cultures of rabbit marrow fibroblastic cells . the mineralized tissue developed within clusters of giant fat cells in the spaces between the cells . investigations with light and electron microscopy demonstrated that in these sites there was some differentiation of the fibroblastic cells in an osteogenic direction , shown by changes to more polygonal shapes , and the synthesis of well-banded collagen similar to that found in bone tissue . differentiation may be due , in part , to increased cell density in a confined space . growth of the mineralized tissue was observed in the living cultures with a fluorescence microscope . electron probe microanalysis confirmed that the mineral formed was hydroxyapatite . initiating sites of mineralization included membranous vesicular bodies , lipid , and products of cellular degeneration . once initiated , mineralization appeared to spread rapidly into adjacent collagenous and other structures , suggesting the appearance of a mixture of skeletal-type and dystrophic mineralization . 
a stochastic analysis of iliac trabecular bone dynamics . published normal histomorphometric data were used to derive distributions of thicknesses of trabecular plates and completed bone remodelling units ( the basic multicellular unit carrying out bone remodelling , the bmu , when completed is termed a structural unit bsu ) . a stochastic model was set up to investigate the predictions of current bmu theory . each of 100 trabecular " thicknesses " was drawn from the appropriate normal distribution using a pseudorandom number generator . each day , each of its two surfaces when quiescent was assumed to have a 1 : 900 chance of initiating a remodelling cycle . resorption ( active , 12 days ; reversal phase , 27 days ) was followed by formation ( 94 + / - 35 days ) and resulted in bmu balance when resorption depth was 36.8 + / - 9.2 micron . fenestration ( thickness less than 0 ) was assumed to lead to permanent loss of the trabecula . the original model unrealistically increased its mean trabecular thickness as thin trabeculae were lost . this was corrected by assuming that thin trabeculae had greater osteoblastic stimulation and a consequent tendency to thicken , perhaps due to higher mechanical loading . over 20 years , 14 % of trabeculae were lost when the bmu balance was exact and the distribution of trabecular thicknesses was unchanged . about one-half of fenestrations were due to deeper-than-average resorption cavities developing in thin trabeculae , and the remainder to coincident remodelling on both surfaces . a 10 % fall in osteoblast lifespan resulted in an additional 36.7 % loss of trabecular bone volume and mean trabecular thickness fell to 83.1 micron , compatible with courpron 's data . simulating more rapid mechanisms of bone loss , approximately 50 % of trabeculae could be lost after ten years by the arrest of bone formation ; the doubling of resorption depth with unchanged bone formation ; and a doubling in the rate of initiation of new bmus with unchanged bone formation rate , all three followed by complete recovery of bmu balance after only two years . in each case , mean trabecular thickness fell only transiently but trabeculae continued to be lost after recovery . prolonged osteoblast life span was the most likely explanation for the increased mean trabecular thicknesses and trabecular bone volumes seen in patients with osteoporosis , when treated with sodium fluoride plus calcium supplements or daily injections of parathyroid peptide hpth 1-34 . 
evolution of a case of multicentric giant cell tumor over a 23-year period . a 17-year-old girl had a multicentric giant cell tumor originating in the sphenoid and sella turcica that was observed for 23 years . during the first 12 years , the same lesion also appeared in the right proximal tibia and left distal radius . curettage of the tibial lesion and packing with processed bovine bone were followed by a chronic osteomyelitis with continued intermittent wound drainage . curettage of the radial lesion and packing it initially with autogenous iliac bone graft and subsequently with methylmethacrylate bone cement were followed by local recurrences . the radial lesion eventually was eradicated by a segmental resection of the distal radius . the resulting bony defect was bridged with a bicortical autogenous iliac graft and stabilized with a bone plate to produce a painless solid wrist fusion . no further tumor recurrence has been noted for the past two years . 
role of subchondral bone in the initiation and progression of cartilage damage . osteoarthrosis is a physiologic imbalance , a " joint failure " similar to " heart failure , " in which mechanical factors play a role . the initiation and progression of cartilage damage are distinct phenomena . one of the mechanisms of initiation may be a steep stiffness gradient in the underlying subchondral bone . progression of cartilage lesions probably requires stiffened subchondral bone . in such situations , transverse stresses at the base of the articular cartilage could cause deep horizontal splits in that tissue . the most likely cause of subchondral stiffening in an otherwise congruent joint is repeated failure of the musculoskeletal peak dynamic force attenuation mechanisms . the health and integrity of the overlying articular cartilage depends on the mechanical properties of its bony bed . in certain models of osteoarthrosis , alterations of the bony bed occur before the cartilage changes and suggest that this can occur in clinical conditions . stiffening of the subchondral bone also can effect joint conformation , which involves deformation of articular cartilage and bone to create maximum contact areas under load . 
immune pathology in polyarticular osteoarthritis . although osteoarthritis ( oa ) generally is considered a disorder of mechanical origin , the common occurrence of chronic mononuclear cell infiltrates in the synovium in conjunction with immunofluorescent evidence for immune-reactant products in cartilage of surgical case specimens ( knees , hips , and peripheral joints ) has suggested the local involvement of immune processes in the arthritis . further , the findings of polyarthropathy in the majority of these cases have indicated the propensity for a systemic disorder . wide variations were noted in both synovial and cartilage immune changes , quite different to those found in rheumatoid arthritis , along with the frequent asymptomatology of the many joints involved . these features , with and without other causative factors , suggest that immune reactions of local and / or systemic origin occur at times in a population at risk for joint degradation . 
estrogens and osteoarthritis . clinical and laboratory observations suggest that a relationship exists between sex hormones and the development of osteoarthritis . the mechanisms whereby these hormones influence the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis have been explored . tamoxifen , an estrogen antagonist , reduced erosive changes in meniscectomy-induced osteoarthritis in rabbits . by contrast , estradiol worsened it . there was no effect of either agent on the incidence of osteophytes in this model . both estradiol and tamoxifen affected proteoglycan , prostaglandin , and proteoglycanase production by cartilage components . these observations suggest that cartilage is a sex hormone-sensitive tissue . this may have therapeutic implications in the future . 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in treatment of osteoarthritis . it is clear that some synovial inflammation occurs in joints affected by osteoarthritis ( oa ) and it is well recognized that many patients with oa experience a decrease in pain and joint stiffness following administration of salicylates or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) . however , neither the extent to which synovitis contributes to the cartilage breakdown in oa nor the effects of chronic administration of nsaids on the natural history of oa in humans is known . recent studies indicate that several nsaids , including salicylates , suppress proteoglycan synthesis in articular cartilage in vitro . the effect on oa cartilage is more marked than that on normal cartilage . other studies show that salicylate feeding may suppress proteoglycan metabolism in degenerating cartilage in vivo , aggravating the decrease in proteoglycan content caused by the disease itself . however , no effect of salicylates on normal articular cartilage has been observed in vivo . in damaged cartilage the magnitude of nsaid-induced suppression of proteoglycan metabolism appears to be related inversely to the proteoglycan content of the tissue . in addition , the nsaids used in treatment of arthritis today may differ with respect to their in vivo effects on articular cartilage metabolism due , in part , to differences between the molar concentrations of these drugs in synovial fluid . 
pediatric management of nonpervasively " hyperactive " children . sixty-five children viewed by their teachers as hyperactive were evaluated as to whether they would benefit from stimulant medication . all underwent extensive neurodevelopmental and educational testing . additional information was obtained from school and parent questionnaires and interviews . children were not placed on medication unless they demonstrated characteristic impulsive , inattentive , and / or overactive behavior in two of three environments ( home , school , clinic ) . fifty-two children ( 80 % ) were not placed on medication . follow-up was completed in 80 percent , and 93 percent of these children were doing well with nonpharmacologic interventions . initial comparison of children not placed and placed on medication revealed that age , race , ses , amount of resource help and retention could not distinguish groups . children placed on medication had difficulties earlier in school ( chi 2 = 4.88 , p less than 0.05 ) , were n't as delayed academically ( chi 2 = 6.30 , p less than 0.05 ) and had less neurodevelopmental disorders ( chi 2 = 9.01 , p less than 0.01 ) . if a careful psychosocial history does not reveal impulsive , inattentive , and / or hyperactive behavior outside of school , a child should be evaluated to rule out neurodevelopmental and educational problems . 
the natural history of idiopathic chest pain in children . a follow-up study . repetitive chest pain of obscure origin is commonly encountered in older children and adolescents . a questionnaire study was conducted to determine the long-term outcome in 31 patients diagnosed as having idiopathic recurrent chest pain after an average 4.1-year follow-up period . although 45 percent reported having had persistent symptoms , chest pain had disappeared in 81 percent of those followed more than 3 years . equally reassuring is the fact that in no case did occult disease subsequently appear to account for the initial symptoms . this study supports the current clinical approach of limited diagnostic evaluation and reassurance in the management of these patients . 
ethyl alcohol ingestion in children . a 15-year review . information on ethyl alcohol intoxication in children is scarce . a retrospective study was conducted by chart reviews of 27 patients with documented ethanol ingestion admitted to the alberta children 's hospital , foothills provincial hospital , calgary general hospital or holy cross hospital from 1969 to 1984. six patients had hypoglycemia and one experienced a convulsion . the rate of alcohol elimination was found to be greater than 6.2 mm / l / hr ( 28.4 mg / dl / hr ) , approximately twice the rate seen in adults . six patients had hypokalemia , and two had severe metabolic acidosis . 
should the mobile intensive care unit respond to pediatric emergencies ? between october 1982 and october 1985 , the mobile intensive care unit ( micu ) in jerusalem responded to 625 pediatric emergencies , representing 5 % of the total micu case load . the most common medical problem was seizures , diagnosed in 205 cases ( 33 % ) . the second most frequent group related to trauma ( 175 cases ; 28 % ) . there were 71 cases ( 11.4 % ) of cardiac arrest . resuscitation was attempted in 37 , but there were no long-term survivors . almost all cardiac arrest patients were found in asystole , and most had antecedent serious medical problems . compared with the adult population , children were less likely to require or benefit from an advanced level of prehospital care . when resources for advanced care are limited , priority should be given to adult emergencies . 
normal radiographic findings after foreign body aspiration . when the history counts . foreign body aspiration in children is frequently associated with unilateral emphysema or atelectasis on chest x-ray . two cases are reported of tracheal or bilateral foreign bodies in which the original chest x-rays were read as normal , but the history was suggestive of the foreign body aspiration . early bronchoscopy can prevent the long-term morbidity that results from unrecognized tracheobronchial foreign bodies .

enhanced dopamine renal responsiveness in patients with hypertension . the purpose of the study was to compare the renal effects of low doses of exogenous dopamine to assess the responsiveness of renal dopaminergic receptors in normotensive and hypertensive subjects . eight hypertensive patients and seven normotensive volunteer subjects were studied . inulin and para-aminohippuric ( pah ) clearances , natriuresis , and fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly after intravenous dosing with dopamine ( 2 micrograms / min / kg ) in both groups . these increases were significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects : 31.8 % + / - 3.7 % vs . 16.2 % + / - 1.2 % for inulin clearance ( p less than 0.01 ) , 83.3 % + / - 10.5 % vs . 41.1 % + / - 3.4 % for pah clearance ( p less than 0.01 ) , and 331 % + / - 38 % vs . 216 % + / - 26 % for natriuresis ( p less than 0.01 ) . these findings suggest hyperresponsiveness to dopamine during hypertension . this enhanced response to exogenous dopamine can be considered as a further argument favoring the existence of a deficit in dopaminergic activity during hypertension . dopamine also induced a significant reduction in blood pressure and increased heart rate in hypertensive subjects but no significant change in blood pressure and heart rate occurred in normotensive subjects . 
effect of the acetylator phenotype on amrinone pharmacokinetics . ten healthy male subjects were phenotyped with isoniazid for their acetylator status and then received intravenous amrinone at a dose of 75 mg during a period of 10 minutes . blood samples were drawn at specified times during a 24-hour period after dosing . plasma concentrations of amrinone were determined by a specific hplc method . the plasma concentration data were fitted to a biexponential model by nonlinear regression . the mean apparent first-order elimination t1 / 2 for amrinone in the slow acetylators was 4.4 hours , whereas it was 2.0 hours in the fast acetylators ( p less than 0.05 ) . there was little difference in the volume of distribution at steady state . clearance was lower in the slow acetylators , 16.6 l / hr , than in the fast acetylators , 37.2 l / hr ( p less than 0.05 ) . the auc was higher for the slow acetylators , 4.96 micrograms x hr x ml-1 , than for the fast acetylators , 2.20 micrograms x hr x ml-1 ( p less than 0.01 ) . concentrations of amrinone and its n-acetyl metabolite in the urine from each volunteer were determined . the ratio of n-acetylamrinone to amrinone was calculated and , as expected , the fast acetylators had a higher ratio than did the slow acetylators ( p less than 0.01 ) . 
combined effects of buspirone and diazepam on objective and subjective tests of performance in healthy volunteers . the combined effects on performance of two anxiolytics with different mechanisms of action were evaluated double-blind and crossover in 12 healthy students . objective ( tracking , divided attention , maddox wing , etc . ) and subjective ( visual analogue scales and questionnaires ) tests were done before and twice after single oral doses . diazepam ( 0.15 and 0.30 mg / kg ) impaired performance dose relatedly and rendered the subjects drowsy , calm , mentally slow , and clumsy . buspirone ( 15 mg ) proved inactive in objective tests but matched diazepam ( 0.30 mg / kg ) subjectively . in combinations , buspirone added to the effects of diazepam in maddox wing and letter cancellation but tended to counteract diazepam effects on divided attention and learning acquisition . subjectively buspirone prolonged diazepam-induced sedation . increased calmness caused by diazepam was not affected by concomitant buspirone . it is suggested that combining small doses of buspirone to diazepam does not cause any additional decrement in psychomotor performance . possible advantages of the diazepam-buspirone combination in therapeutic use are discussed . 
quantitation of drug levels and platelet receptor blockade caused by a thromboxane antagonist . sq 28 , 668 is a structural analog of thromboxane a2 . it inhibits the effects of thromboxane in vitro . fifty-six healthy male subjects were given either placebo or three equal daily doses of sq 28 , 668 ranging from 25 to 1200 mg . plasma drug concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner . the shape of the plasma drug concentration-time curve was consistent with enterohepatic recirculation . the effects of sq 28 , 668 on ex vivo platelet aggregation suggested that sq 28 , 668 is a specific competitive antagonist of thromboxane a2 with a platelet receptor dissociation constant ( estimated by schild analysis ) of about 19 nmol / l . approximately 94 % occupation of thromboxane receptors by sq 28 , 668 was required to produce a small but measurable increase of the template bleeding time . dose-ranging studies of antithrombotic drugs are difficult and expensive . for this reason , a method was developed that allows estimation of the dose of a thromboxane receptor antagonist that would be expected to be therapeutically equivalent to a given dose of aspirin . 
effect of cirrhosis and debrisoquin phenotype on the disposition and effects of pinacidil . pinacidil is an investigational vasodilator currently undergoing clinical trials as an antihypertensive agent . it is metabolized in humans to pinacidil n-oxide . to determine whether pinacidil 's metabolism or effects were influenced by either liver disease or the subject 's debrisoquin phenotype , eight patients with chronic stable cirrhosis and 13 healthy subjects were studied . seven of the healthy volunteers were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin , whereas six were of the poor metabolizer phenotype . neither the clearance of pinacidil nor the production of the n-oxide was altered by the subjects ' debrisoquin phenotype . cirrhosis produced a 50 % reduction in pinacidil 's clearance ( 20.7 + / - 1.4 vs . 42.1 + / - 5.1 l / hr ; p less than 0.0005 ) and a prolongation in the elimination t1 / 2 from 3.9 + / - 0.3 to 6.1 + / - 0.6 hours ( p less than 0.01 ) . less pinacidil was metabolized to the n-oxide metabolite in the patients with cirrhosis than in the normal individuals . thus pinacidil 's metabolism and clearance are reduced in patients with cirrhosis but are independent of debrisoquin phenotype . 
ritodrine pharmacokinetics . the purpose of this study was to add to the limited information available regarding the pharmacology of ritodrine in the peripartum period when treatment fails and labor is not inhibited . plasma or urine samples from eight parturients and 13 infants were studied ; in addition plasma samples at delivery were obtained from a total of 26 mothers and infants . all the mothers received ritodrine in the 24 hours before delivery . plasma and urine ritodrine ( free and conjugated ) were determined with hplc by electrochemical detection . in maternal plasma , an apparent rapid distribution phase with a t1 / 2 of 32 + / - 21 minutes was followed by a prolonged equilibrium phase with a t1 / 2 of 17 + / - 10 hours . seventy-six percent of the ritodrine excreted by the mother was in the form of a conjugate . ninety percent of the ritodrine excreted by the neonate was also excreted in the form of a conjugate . 
the effect of single intravenous doses of cimetidine or ranitidine on gastric secretion . intravenous cimetidine , 300 mg or 400 mg , or ranitidine , 50 mg , was administered as a single dose to 36 volunteers in a randomized , crossover fashion . aspirates of gastric juice were obtained after dosing , and the ph , titratable acidity , gastric fluid volume , and gastric acid output were determined from baseline through 71 / 2 hours for each subject . each intervention significantly increased ph and suppressed hydrogen ion concentration , gastric fluid volume , and gastric acid output . both the magnitudes of the changes when compared with baseline and the time of the mean maximum effects were similar in all three drug regimens . the effect of all three interventions on gastric fluid volume and gastric acid output diminished sharply after 6 hours . the data indicate that the gastric secretory response to all three interventions did not differ substantially . 
systemic absorption of inhaled epinephrine . to determine the systemic absorption of epinephrine when it is given by inhalation , six normal volunteers were given 15 puffs , followed by 30 puffs , of epinephrine from a pressurized aerosol ( 160 micrograms epinephrine / puff ) . the peak mean ( + / - se ) plasma epinephrine levels were 1.50 ( + / - 0.61 ) and 4.22 ( + / - 1.93 ) nmol / l 1 minute after each dose , respectively . the effect on physiologic finger tremor correlated with the plasma epinephrine level and returned to baseline 20 minutes after taking the higher dose . there was a small fall in mean plasma potassium levels of 0.45 mmol / l and a small rise in plasma glucose levels of 0.81 mmol / l . on a separate occasion an injection of 0.3 ml of 1 / 1000 ( 300 micrograms ) epinephrine was given subcutaneously to the same individuals . this caused a peak plasma epinephrine level of 2.43 ( + / - 0.47 ) nmol / l at 10 minutes , and this was still raised at 2.05 ( + / - 0.41 ) nmol / l after 40 minutes . the maximum fall in the mean plasma potassium level was 0.43 mmol / l after the injection . 
effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on left ventricular mass in patients with hypertension . reductions in left ventricular ( lv ) mass have been reported after antihypertensive therapy with certain sympatholytic agents and converting enzyme inhibitors , but little or no improvement has been noted after vasodilator therapy . in this study we evaluated the effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on echocardiographic lv mass . during a 12-month period , nitrendipine was used as monotherapy in 30 patients and in combination with propranolol or a diuretic in an additional 28 patients . nitrendipine monotherapy lowered supine blood pressure from 148 / 97 to 136 / 83 mm hg , but lv mass did not change significantly . supine blood pressure decreased from 155 / 103 to 134 / 86 mm hg in patients receiving combination therapy but , again , changes in lv mass were not significant . these data suggest that nitrendipine is effective in lowering blood pressure , but this is not associated with a significant decrease in lv mass in patients with mild hypertension .

psychosis and pregnancy . close , continuous collaboration among the obstetrician , the psychiatrist , and nurses in both disciplines is required to improve the mental health of a patient whose psychosis is associated with pregnancy . these most complex cases require not " either / or " management but the combined attention of specialists in both disciplines . 
schizophrenia and antipsychotic drugs . a variety of effective drugs are available for the treatment of schizophrenia . knowledge of the side-effect spectrum of the various classes of antipsychotic drugs is necessary for the clinician to arrive at a rational choice of medication . in general , the preferred drug will be a high-potency neuroleptic . the following basic principles of clinical psychopharmacology should be followed : consider risk and benefits ; clinical experience is prerequisite ; establish the diagnosis ; select the appropriate class of psychotropic drug for the primary diagnosis ; within drug class , the drugs are usually equally effective for patients with the diagnosis ; give a dose that is high enough to be effective ; choose target symptoms that can be monitored to indicate when to stop or increase the drug ; avoid use of multiple drugs when possible ; drugs are only one element in a comprehensive treatment strategy . other modalities need equally careful consideration , e.g. , psychotherapy , group therapy , family treatment , and vocational rehabilitation ; and consultation with other subspecialists should be sought readily when indicated . 
management of anxiety in the elderly . clinicians need to be aware of the cardinal manifestations of clinical anxiety in their geriatric patients . a variety of psychotherapeutic , behavioral , and chemical interventions can effectively and safely treat anxiety in geriatric patients and thereby greatly diminish morbidity and mortality .

a new method for intraoral patch testing . intraoral patch testing was performed in 3 subjects , 2 of whom were contact sensitive to nickel . maxillary acrylic plates carrying test pieces containing 66 % nickel were applied for 48 h , and readings were performed 24 h after removal . few if any clinical signs were detected , but biopsies from the mucosal contact sites showed lichenoid reactions . biopsies from control sites showed no or slight non-specific inflammatory reactions . 
dermatitis from quinazoline oxide . dermatitis from 2-chloromethyl-4-phenyl-6-chloroquinazoline-3-oxide , an intermediate product in the preparation of chlorodiazepoxide , is described in 29 workers at a pharmaceutical plant . all were patch test positive to quinazoline oxide ( 1 % ) and six to 0.05 % . in most patients , the face was earlier and more severely involved than the hands . some were sensitized even if they did not have much contact with it , doing such work as washing the clothing of other workers , or working at a distance of 100 m from the production line building . 
allergic contact sensitization to the glycidyl ester of hexahydrophthalic acid in a cutting oil . allergic contact dermatitis is reported in 5 machine operatives working with a cutting oil containing an epoxy compound used as a stabilizer . positive patch test reactions to this compound were obtained in all 5 men and were negative in 25 controls . 
skin reflectance measurements of patch test responses . skin reflectance values were used as an objective measure of skin haemoglobin content at patch test sites to facilitate quantification of the erythematous response to contact allergens in patients with allergic contact dermatitis . reflectance measurements of patch test responses correlated well with the clinical scoring and provided a numerical measure of reaction severity . experimental contact allergen formulations were also evaluated by this method . 
discomfort from rubber gloves indicating contact urticaria . rubber glove intolerance is a common dermatological problem and hypersensitivity of both delayed and immediate types occur . in order to study immediate skin reactions induced by rubber gloves , 15 patients with discomfort and itch produced by rubber gloves were examined . the patients were provoked by wearing rubber gloves , scratch tested with gloves , rubber chemicals and powders . rast-tests were performed using an extract from the rubber tree ( hevea brasiliensis ) . in 6 / 15 patients , contact urticaria was confirmed , in 3 of whom ige antibodies to latex were demonstrated . 
sensitization to epichlorohydrin and epoxy system components . in an epoxy resin manufacturing plant , 26 of 228 ( 11.4 % ) workers had work-related eruptions ; 19 were patch tested . the test series consisted of chemicals used in the manufacturing process , a standard battery and some other sensitizers . the prevalence of sensitization to epichlorohydrin and / or epoxy resins in the whole group was 6.1 % . a relatively high prevalence ( 3.5 % ) of epichlorohydrin sensitization was found . 10 cases of sensitization to liquid epoxy resin ( mw about 385 ) were observed , in 7 cases combined with allergy to solid epoxy resin ( mw 980 ) . sensitization to bisphenol a was not seen .

an analysis of 501 consecutive contact clinic consultations . a simple micro-computer program was used to analyse the results of testing 501 consecutive patients attending a patch test clinic . 64 % of males and 71 % of females had positive tests ; 17 % of males and 12 % of females had occupational dermatitis ; 16 % of males and 15 % of females had irritant contact dermatitis ; and 13 % of males and 19 % of females had a history of atopic eczema . 
contact dermatitis from grevillea ' robyn gordon ' . grevillea ' robyn gordon ' is an australian hybrid plant which may cause allergic contact dermatitis . over the past 8 years , it has been planted extensively in australia and is now being exported to the united states and other western countries . recently , an explosion in incidence of contact dermatitis due to this plant has been seen . 24 patients who were suspected of being sensitive to it were patch tested to fresh plant and extracts with confirmation of sensitivity . a cross sensitivity to toxicodendron was demonstrated clinically and on patch testing . the allergen in toxicodendron , 3 pentadecylcatechol , is closely linked in chemical structure to 5-pentadecylresorcinol , present in grevillea banksii and tridecylresorcinol in grevillea robusta . patch testing in patients sensitive to grevillea ' robyn gordon ' with tridecylresorcinol produced positive reactions , thus implicating the sensitizing role of long chain alkyl resorcinols in grevillea ' robyn gordon ' allergy . there is a likelihood that this sensitizing potential extends to other plants of the grevillea genus , e.g. , grevillea robusta . with the spread of grevillea ' robyn gordon ' to other markets , this problem will become increasingly common . 
occupational skin disease in hospital cleaning and kitchen workers . skin disorders were reported in 33 % of catering staff and 35 % of women cleaners who returned a questionnaire , and were employed in a large hospital . hand dermatitis occurred in 15 % of the caterers and 12 % of the cleaners . in the majority , the dermatitis was irritant in origin and related to their wet work occupations . cleaners had a high prevalence of jewellery dermatitis . limited patch testing revealed a majority positive to nickel , but a third were negative , indicating that jewellery reactions often but not invariably predict nickel sensitivity . few subjects were atopic , but some psoriatic patients with hand problems were encountered . most workers were able to carry on in their occupations despite having hand dermatitis . 
age and sex incidence of allergic contact dermatitis . a retrospective study of patients patch tested between 1968 and 1970 was undertaken and case records of 200 patients with unequivocal positive patch tests were studied for age and sex distribution . there was an overall female preponderance ( 61 % ) , with 2 peaks of incidence in the 10-20 and 40-50 year age groups in females , but only 1 peak of incidence in the 40-50 year age group in males . there was a steady decline in all sensitivities after the 6th decade of life in both sexes . nickel sensitivity was more common in females ( 92 % ) , whereas dichromate sensitivity predominated in males ( 64 % ) . of the 200 patients , only 5 ( 2.5 % ) were atopics , all of whom were females . 
sensitization to sodium hypochlorite causing hand dermatitis . 2 patients are reported with chronic hand dermatitis related to sensitization to sodium hypochlorite , as the active component in a bleaching product . to avoid irritant reactions in patch testing , a sodium hypochlorite concentration of 1.0 % appeared to be useful . it is concluded that with regard to the frequent use of bleaching agents , allergy to sodium hypochlorite must be considered in certain cases of unidentified chronic allergic hand dermatitis . 
animal model for assessment of skin irritancy . irritant skin reactions from repeated open applications of low concentrations of sodium lauryl sulphate ( sls ) have been studied macroscopically and microscopically in guinea pigs . after 3 applications daily for 3 days , 2 % sls aqueous solutions gave a naked eye assessment , increase in epidermal thickness and total dermal inflammatory cell response , which was greater than for a 1 % sls solution . the dermal inflammatory cell response was mainly mononuclear ( lymphocytic ) in nature . with the sls reactions as control , various organic solvents were studied and ranked against the sls reactions and internally . trichlorethylene was the most irritant solvent , ranking as high as 2 % sls . other chlorinated hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons tested caused irritant reactions . the alcohols and acetone gave no reaction . white spirit was as irritant as trichlorethylene . thinners were less irritant , around the level of the 1 % sls control reaction . the 4-day experimental design is a convenient and suitable animal model for screening irritant potential , and provides information relevant to the pathogenesis of irritant contact reactions . 
irritation , sensitization , photoirritation and photosensitization assays with a glyphosate herbicide . glyphosate , a widely utilized herbicide , was evaluated for acute irritation , cumulative irritation , photoirritation and allergic and photoallergic contact potential in 346 volunteers . the herbicide was less irritant than a standard liquid dishwashing detergent and a general all purpose cleaner . there was no evidence for the induction of photoirritation , allergic or photoallergic contact dermatitis . 10 % glyphosate in water is proposed as a diagnostic patch test concentration . 
the sensitizing capacity of coumarins ( i ) . 10 coumarins used in perfumery , cosmetics and ointments , have been investigated by 2 different methods to determine their sensitizing capacity . only 1 of the compounds , 4-methyl-esculetin , which serves as a sunscreen agent , was found to be a weak sensitizer . all other coumarins were negative . it is assumed that this dihydroxycoumarin becomes a sensitizer when it is enzymically oxidized to the corresponding orthoquinone in the skin . 
chloracne from pentachlorophenol-preserved wood . a patient is presented who developed chloracne after exposure to lumber which was pressure-treated with pentachlorophenol ( pcp ) . it was presumed that his disease arose via percutaneous absorption of polychlorinated aromatic compounds ( dioxins and furans ) which are known to contaminate technical grade pcp . the patient 's condition improved after treatment with oral isotretinoin . 
cobalt and nickel content of asian cements . the total cobalt and nickel concentration of 11 brands of asian cement ranged from 8.1 to 14.2 micrograms / g and 14.9 to 28.5 micrograms / g , respectively . these metals exist mainly as insoluble salts ; the water-soluble concentration of cobalt and nickel in the cements ranged from 0.39 to 0.65 micrograms / g and from 0-1.2 micrograms / g , respectively . 1.5 % ( 4 / 272 ) of construction workers in a prefabrication construction factory had cobalt sensitivity . all had allergic contact dermatitis from chromate in cement . no worker had isolated cobalt sensitivity and cement dermatitis . it appeared that sensitization to cobalt in cement occurs only secondarily to an existing cement dermatitis . 1.8 % ( 5 / 272 ) workers had nickel sensitivity : 2 with allergic contact dermatitis to nickel in their watches , 2 were asymptomatic and 1 had allergic contact dermatitis to chromate and cobalt in cement . the low prevalence of cobalt and nickel sensitivity from cement was probably related to the low concentration of soluble cobalt and nickel salts in the cement . however , these insoluble salts can form soluble complexes with body fluids on eczematous skin and sensitize the skin . 
permeation of nickel salts through human skin in vitro . the impact of occlusion and the role of the counter ion on the permeation of nickel ions through skin have been examined using excised human skin . a highly sensitive electrochemical method was used to quantify the amount of nickel permeating the skin . the investigations show that nickel ions are capable of permeating the skin barrier when applied under occlusion . the process is slow , having a lag time of approximately 50 h . the permeation rate , and thus the physical amount being bioavailable , is considerably increased when aqueous nickel chloride is used in comparison with aqueous nickel sulphate . with respect to nickel permeation of the skin , we conclude that the choice of salt is an important consideration in patch testing . 
eyelid dermatitis : the role of atopy and contact allergy . patients with eyelid dermatitis were studied with patch tests and a clinical point method for the diagnosis of atopic skin disease . in 38 patients , contact allergy was found in 11. the dermatitis was an expression of atopic dermatitis in 15 patients .

c3a and adult respiratory distress syndrome after massive transfusion . we compared the degree of complement activation in 15 patients receiving massive blood transfusions and 21 patients with the septic syndrome and examined its association with other risk factors for adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . patients with massive transfusion ( n = 8 ) as their only risk factor for ards had lower c3a levels ( 250 + / - 80 ng / ml ) and a lower incidence of ards ( 0 % ) than patients with massive transfusion plus other risk factors ( n = 7 ; c3a , 600 + / - 120 ng / ml ; ards , 55 % ) or patients with the septic syndrome ( n = 21 ; c3a , 540 + / - 80 ng / ml ; ards , 19 % ) . in our patients , the degree of complement activation appeared to reflect the presence of complicating clinical conditions . 
cardiorespiratory and conjunctival oxygen tension monitoring during resuscitation from hemorrhage . placement of an unheated miniaturized oxygen electrode against the palpebral conjunctiva permits noninvasive measurement of tissue oxygen tension . in this study , the relationship between conjunctival oxygen tension ( pcjo2 ) and standard cardiorespiratory variables was examined during a sequential resuscitation protocol after acute hemorrhage . anesthetized dogs were rapidly bled to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm hg and then retransfused with the shed blood in a stepwise fashion . pcjo2 fell to 2 % of control values after hemorrhage and did not return to prehemorrhage values until more than 90 % of the shed blood had been reinfused . pcjo2 was among the last set of cardiorespiratory variables to return to control values during resuscitation and was the last noninvasive variable to normalize . the ratio of pcjo2 to arterial oxygen tension decreased from a prehemorrhage value of 0.76 + / - 0.05 ( sem ) to 0.02 + / - 0.003 after hemorrhage , and did not increase to values greater than 0.50 until resuscitation was more than 90 % complete . conjunctival oxygen monitoring may play an important role in assessing the adequacy of resuscitation after acute hemorrhage . 
metabolism in acute cerebrovascular disease . oxygen consumption ( vo2 ) , co2 production , respiratory quotient , resting metabolic expenditure ( rme ) , and urine catecholamine levels were measured in 52 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease . rme correlated positively with urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine excretion ; its maximum value was 187 % higher than expected for an uninjured resting person of equivalent age , sex , and size . vo2 correlated positively with the urinary catecholamine excretion . these facts imply that the sympathetic nervous system might directly influence vo2 and rme . moreover , the hypermetabolic state should be taken into consideration when caring for patients with cerebrovascular disease , as malnutrition might cause weight loss and a decrease in immunity . 
icu survival of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome . the icu records of 31 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were reviewed . of 23 ( 74 % ) patients admitted for respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation , 20 ( 87 % ) patients had pneumocystis carinii and / or cytomegalovirus pneumonia . of the eight patients admitted without respiratory failure , five ( 63 % ) were monitored after brain biopsy . respiratory failure patients remained in the icu for 10 + / - 1 days , compared to 5 + / - 1 days for those without respiratory failure ( p less than .05 ) . overall mortality was 24 patients ( 77 % ) ; 21 ( 91 % ) of 23 respiratory failure patients died , compared to three ( 38 % ) of the eight without respiratory failure ( p less than .01 ) . all seven icu survivors lived to hospital discharge . 
work of breathing through different sized endotracheal tubes . the ability to breathe spontaneously through an endotracheal tube is a usual prerequisite before an intubated patient can have it removed . other researchers have measured air flow resistance through endotracheal tubes . in this study , we evaluated work of breathing in joules per min and tension-time index while three normal volunteers breathed through different sized endotracheal tubes . four 27.5-cm endotracheal tubes were used . subjects breathed with a constant tidal volume of 500 ml . by increasing respiratory frequency , minute ventilation was increased from 5 to 30 l / min . as tube diameter decreased , work and the tension-time index increased . changes were magnified at higher minute ventilations through the 6- and 7-mm endotracheal tubes , and the tension-time index critical fatigue level of 0.15 was approached or exceeded . 
hemodynamic and oxygen transport effects of dobutamine in critically ill general surgical patients . the effects of dobutamine on hemodynamic and oxygen transport were evaluated in 43 studies on 34 critically ill general ( noncardiac ) surgical patients . dobutamine , beginning at a low dose ( 2.5 micrograms / kg x min ) significantly increased cardiac index ( ci ) , oxygen delivery ( do2 ) , and oxygen consumption ( vo2 ) , while decreasing mean arterial pressure , pulmonary artery and wedge pressures , and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances ; blood gases , ph , and pulmonary shunt were not significantly changed . these effects were seen in postoperative and septic patients , as well as in patients with normal , low , and high control ci . these responses were poor in terminally ill and hypovolemic patients ; however , when the latter were given additional fluids , their responses were markedly improved . the hemodynamic effects of dobutamine are well known , but the do2 and vo2 effects , which suggest improved tissue perfusion , have not been appreciated . 
comparison of transthoracic electrical impedance and thermodilution methods for measuring cardiac output . cardiac output was measured 120 times in 27 critically ill patients using the thermodilution and transthoracic electrical impedance methods . both the minimum and mean values for the distance between the inner electrodes , and a variety of values for the resistivity of blood ( rho ) were substituted in the kubicek 's empiric formula for calculating cardiac output by transthoracic electrical impedance . using the mean distance between the inner electrodes and a rho-value of 150 ohm x cm gave the best agreement between the methods ( mean difference 0.17 + / - 2.4 l / min ) . ventilation alone or with positive end-expiratory pressure did not significantly affect the bias of the estimate , but both affected its precision when compared with measurements in spontaneously breathing patients ( sd of mean difference 2.4 and 3.2 l / min , respectively , vs . 1.5 l / min ) . the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was significantly higher in patients with an abnormal diastolic impedance waveform ( zero-wave ) , but there was no relationship between wedge pressure and base impedance per unit length between the measuring electrodes . 
effect of high-dose dopamine on urine output in newborn infants . to achieve adequate arterial bp , adequate capillary filling time , and adequate peripheral pulses , hypotensive newborn infants often require higher doses of dopamine that reportedly reduce urine output in adults . whether these larger doses of dopamine also reduce urine output in newborns is not known . therefore , we determined the effects of administering high-dose dopamine ( more than 20 micrograms / kg x min ) on the urine output of 15 newborn infants . five infants were studied prospectively and ten retrospectively . in the prospective study , urine output was determined as the dose of dopamine was increased ; in the retrospective study , urine output was determined as the infants were being weaned from high doses of dopamine . both data sets demonstrate that administering high-dosage dopamine does not reduce the urine output of sick newborn infants . therefore , we conclude that doses of dopamine previously reported to decrease urine output in adults do not do so in sick newborn infants . consequently , when necessary , high doses of dopamine may be used in sick newborn infants to achieve cardiovascular stability without reducing urine output . 
transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring during neonatal transport . we studied the value of transcutaneous carbon dioxide ( ptcco2 ) monitoring during neonatal transport . thirty-two neonates with respiratory distress were alternately enrolled in an experimental group ( results of ptco2 and ptcco2 available for clinical management ) and a control group ( results of only ptco2 available ) . although differences were not significant , infants in the experimental group had more changes in the intermittent mandatory ventilation ( imv ) settings during transport , and more such infants arrived at the receiving hospital with acceptable ph and pco2 values . on arrival at the receiving hospital , two patients in the control group had acidosis and hypercarbia and were placed on imv immediately on arrival . no such patients were encountered in the experimental group . for patients needing imv during transport , the percentage of study time spent with ptcco2 measurements in the normal range ( 35 to 45 torr ) was greater for the experimental group ( p less than .02 ) . continuous ptcco2 monitoring during transport offers the opportunity to further decrease the risks of transporting a critically ill neonate . 
plasma fibronectin in severe infectious purpura of children . plasma fibronectin levels were determined in 34 children admitted with severe infectious purpura . fibronectin concentration was decreased in severe infectious purpura as in other sepsis , but there was no significant difference between shock and nonshock patients . fibronectin levels were lower in children with ecchymotic or necrotic purpura on admission than in those with petechial purpura ; they were lower in those who developed cutaneous sequelae , but it is not known if correction of fibronectin deficiency may limit the extent of purpura and prevent the cutaneous sequelae . 
early experience with continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration in critically ill pediatric patients . the applicability of continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration ( cavh ) for renal replacement therapy was evaluated in three infants and two young children with catastrophic medical and surgical illnesses . in the first four patients , cavh was used in conjunction with either peritoneal or hemodialysis . in the fifth patient , cavh was the sole renal replacement therapy employed ; in this critically ill anuric infant , we were best able to evaluate the ability of cavh to continuously control fluid , electrolyte , and acid-base balance , and allow the administration of adequate parenteral nutrition . the difficulties encountered were related to anticoagulation , establishment of adequate vascular access , and selection of an appropriate hemofilter for the performance of the technique . despite the application of suction-assistance , we were unable to effectively employ a prototype pediatric hemofilter to attain a level of plasma ultrafiltration consistent with the objectives of therapy . however , we were able to effectively and safely employ an adult hemofilter for these purposes ; modifications were made in the adult hemofilter system before its application in the smallest pediatric patients . our experience suggests that , even in critically ill infants , cavh can be successfully applied as an effective renal replacement therapy . however , further experience is required before its potential impact on patient survival can be assessed .

post-extubation pulmonary edema following anesthesia induced by upper airway obstruction . are certain patients at increased risk ? pulmonary edema due to upper airway obstruction can be observed in a variety of clinical situations . the predominant mechanism is increased negative intrathoracic pressure , although hypoxia and cardiac and neurologic factors may contribute . laryngospasm associated with intubation and general anesthesia is a common cause of pulmonary edema in children . however , only seven cases of pulmonary edema presumably due to laryngospasm have been reported in adolescents and adults . five of the seven had other risk factors for upper airway obstruction , and in four , the diagnosis of " laryngospasm " could be explained by other factors . patients with underlying risk factors for upper airway obstruction , such as a forme fruste of sleep apnea or nasopharyngeal abnormalities , appear to be at increased risk for the development of pulmonary edema in the setting of intubation and anesthesia . this form of pulmonary edema usually resolves rapidly without the need for aggressive therapy or invasive monitoring . 
central vs peripheral venous catheters in critically ill patients . a prospective study of 2 , 209 intravenous catheters was performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit to determine when and why catheters were removed and which sites of insertion were associated with the least morbidity . techniques of insertion were vigorously supervised . central and peripheral catheters were cared for by identical protocols . overt phlebitis or inflammation around the site was 14 times as common with peripheral catheters ( 353 / 1 , 024 ) than with centrally inserted central catheters ( 18 / 713 ) , even though peripheral catheters were removed on the average at 2.9 days and centrally inserted central catheters at 6.2 days . pneumothorax occurred in seven out of 713 patients with centrally inserted central catheterization , one with hemothorax and two with pneumothoraces requiring thoracostomy tubes . five were treated successfully with simple catheter aspiration . three patients out of 1 , 496 with peripheral or peripherally inserted central catheters required phlebectomy for suppurative thrombophlebitis . we concluded that overall morbidity in critically ill patients is lower from centrally inserted central catheters than peripheral intravenous catheters , with peripherally inserted central catheters in an intermediate position . supervision of techniques of insertion has to be kept at a high level to keep complications of central catheterization at an acceptable level . peripheral catheter sites would be better maintained with more frequent replacement of the catheter . 
effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate in obstructive sleep apnea . we studied the effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate , a respiratory stimulant , on the incidence and duration of episodes of apnea and disordered breathing in 13 nonhypercapnic men with obstructive sleep apnea . nocturnal polysomnography was done before and after four weeks of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( 60 mg / day ) and one week after cessation of treatment . there were no significant ( p less than 0.05 ) differences in the mean frequency of apneic episodes per hour of sleep before ( 31.3 + / - 5.7 [ + / - se ] ) , during ( 26.8 + / - 6.6 ) , or after ( 23.6 + / - 7.0 ) treatment , or in the mean number of disordered breathing episodes per hour of sleep before ( 19.4 + / - 5.6 ) , during ( 21.4 + / - 5.8 ) , or after ( 23.1 + / - 6.3 ) the period of treatment . medroxyprogesterone did not alter significantly the total time of apnea or the total time for disordered breathing , expressed as percentages of total sleep time . arterial oxygen desaturation during apnea and disordered breathing did not change with treatment . medroxyprogesterone increased the minute ventilation and occlusion pressure responses to hypercapnia measured in the awake state ; however , the results of this study demonstrate that medroxyprogesterone does not improve the breathing disorders during sleep in the nonhypercapnic patient with obstructive sleep apnea . 
amyloidosis of the lower respiratory tract . clinical and pathologic features in a series of 21 patients . twenty one cases of amyloidosis of the lower respiratory tract were seen at a single center . in three patients , multifocal bronchial amyloid plaques led to stenosis and atelectasis , and in two , small pseudotumor masses were an incidental bronchoscopic finding . two patients had nodular parenchymal amyloidosis , in one of whom the lesions were progressive and in the other static . fifteen patients had diffuse parenchymal amyloidosis . two of these had severe interstitial involvement and died in respiratory failure ; eight had congestive cardiac failure , and parenchymal amyloidosis was a post-mortem finding ; two had senile cardiorespiratory amyloidosis , also found at autopsy ; and in three , the amyloidosis was associated with malignancy . the degree of respiratory embarrassment seemed to be related to the amount of amyloid in the gas diffusion zones , irrespective of the etiology of amyloidosis . 
effect of alprazolam on exercise and dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . to evaluate the efficacy of a mild anxiolytic , alprazolam , in relieving dyspnea , we conducted a randomized , placebo-controlled double-blind study on patients with chronic obstructive lung disease . twenty-four patients had alprazolam ( 0.5 mg bid ) or placebo administered for one week , followed by placebo for one week , then either placebo or alprazolam for the third week . assessment tests were performed at the outset , end of the first and second weeks , and finally end of the third week . the parameters measured were : pulmonary function , exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer , and the distance covered in a 12 minute walk . subjective sensations of dyspnea at rest and during guarded exercise , as well as subjective feelings of calmness or anxiety were also recorded . there was no difference in mechanical lung function , but the po2 tended to decrease and pco2 to increase after alprazolam administration . the maximum exercise level attained and the distance covered in the 12 minute walk was unchanged . the subjective perception of dyspnea was the same before and after alprazolam , at rest and during exercise . we conclude that alprazolam is not effective in relieving exercise dyspnea in patients with obstructive lung disease . 
effect of mechanical ventilation on hepatic drug pharmacokinetics . mechanical ventilation was able to induce a decrease in cardiac output and regional blood flow , especially hepatic flow . thus , hepatic elimination of drugs with a high hepatic-extraction ratio , which was linked to alteration in hepatic blood flow , could be reduced during mechanical ventilation . the aim of this work was to determine the effect of mechanical ventilation on pharmacokinetic parameters of lidocaine , which is a well-known nonrestrictive elimination drug at the hepatic level . five patients ( mean age , 58 years ) with normal hepatic function and quite similar gasometric parameters before and after weaning from mechanical ventilation were studied . with a washout period of 48 hours between mechanical ventilation and spontaneous ventilation , each patient was submitted to the following protocol : lidocaine in a bolus ( 1.5 mg / kg intravenously ) , followed by infusion ( 1.0 to 1.7 mg / min for 120 minutes ) . the results were that the peak plasma concentration after the bolus during mechanical ventilation was 3.22 + / - 0.37 mg / l ( mean + / - se ) vs 2.40 + / - 0.35 mg / l during spontaneous ventilation ( p less than 0.02 ) . steady-state plasma concentration during mechanical ventilation was 2.10 + / - 0.20 mg / l vs 1.64 + / - 0.16 mg / l during spontaneous ventilation ( p less than 0.01 ) . total clearance was 604.2 + / - 87.0 ml / min during mechanical ventilation vs 775.0 + / - 112.1 ml / min during spontaneous ventilation ( p less than 0.01 ) . elimination half-life was 245.2 + / - 50.6 minutes during mechanical ventilation vs 160.0 + / - 40.6 minutes during spontaneous ventilation ( p less than 0.05 ) . distribution volume was 188.6 + / - 50.2 l during mechanical ventilation and 183.0 + / - 50.8 l during spontaneous ventilation ( not significant ) . these preliminary data clearly demonstrated a decrease in lidocaine elimination in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation , but the magnitude of dosage adjustment of such a highly hepatic-extracted drug in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation remains to be investigated . 
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of right and left internal mammary artery grafts . four patients with recurrent severe angina and evidence of myocardial ischemia two to six months after surgical coronary revascularization have been submitted to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the distal insertion of internal mammary artery grafts or of the recipient vessel distal to it . these cases illustrate the feasibility and safety of transluminal angioplasty of right and left internal mammary artery grafts , using the mammary artery as a way of access . 
maximum flow ratios at mid-vital capacity in young healthy adults . upper airway obstruction is usually diagnosed by visual examination of maximum expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume curves and by calculating a ratio of expiratory to inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity ( mid-vital capacity flow ratio ) ; however , reference values of this ratio have not been well established , and considerable variability exists . the purpose of this study was to examine the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios in a group of healthy subjects and to determine if some of the variability is accounted for by different maximum inspiratory pressures . we measured maximum expiratory and inspiratory flows at 50 percent of vital capacity from the flow-volume curves , and maximum inspiratory pressures in a group of 60 healthy nonsmokers ( 30 men and 30 women ) whose ages ranged from 21 to 40 years . we found that mid-vital capacity flow ratio ( mean + / - sd ) was 0.72 + / - 0.19 in men and 0.77 + / - 0.18 in women . the coefficient of variation of the mid-vital capacity flow ratio was 28 percent for men and 23 percent for women . the 95 percent confidence limits for the mid-vital capacity flow ratio were 0.65 to 0.79 for men and 0.70 to 0.84 for women . maximum inspiratory pressures ( mean + / - sd ) were 129 + / - 30 cm h2o in men and 91 + / - 16 cm h2o in women , not significantly different from previous studies . normalizing maximum inspiratory flow for maximum inspiratory pressure did not reduce the coefficient of variation , which became 29 percent in men and 30 percent in women . we conclude that the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios is wide , and it cannot be reduced by standardizing it for maximum inspiratory pressures . 
conduction system in cases of sudden death in congenital heart disease many years after surgical correction . the conduction system and the entire heart were examined histologically in four patients with congenital heart disease who had surgery many years before they died suddenly . all were asymptomatic , in sinus rhythm and living normally . the sudden death may have been related to alterations in the conduction system , previously present , or introduced by the previous surgery , or related to inflammatory phenomena , an outgrowth of the previous surgery . 
an angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitor in human serum . increased sensitivity of the serum ace assay for detecting active sarcoidosis . measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ace ) is extremely useful as an aid in the diagnosis and longitudinal evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis . we have detected a human serum ace-inhibitor which affects the ace level obtained by activity measurements . the effect of the inhibitor can be eliminated by a mere eight-fold dilution of the serum sample with physiologic saline . we recommend that serum ace be performed with 1 : 8 dilutions of serum to eliminate the effect of the ace inhibitor . the inhibitor has a mw above 50 , 000 daltons , and reversibility of inhibition by dilution appears to be ion dependent . dialysis of an inhibitor-containing serum sample against saline causes the inhibition to become irreversible , allowing the distinction between alinearity of the assay vs an inhibitor effect when a serum has ace activity greater than 50 units / ml . the source of the serum ace-inhibitor remains to be determined .

duplication of the inferior vena cava in thromboembolic disease . recurrent pulmonary embolism from the lower extremities or pelvis , despite anticoagulation , often requires interruption of the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) . we report two patients in whom interruption of the ivc failed to ameliorate symptoms . both patients demonstrated a previously unrecognized duplication of the ivc . we stress the importance of excluding abdominal venous anomalies prior to interrupting the ivc using surgical or percutaneous methods .

intrasubject variability of theophylline clearance in a morbidly obese patient . it is well appreciated that theophylline pharmacokinetics exhibits wide intersubject variation . within-subject changes in clearance have been generally reported in patients with acute exacerbations of disease states such as cor pulmonale or heart failure . apparent random changes in theophylline clearance within the same patient have recently been reported . this report describes a case of suspected changes in the clearance of theophylline in a morbidly obese patient ( 250 kg ) over a two-month period of time . frequent dosage adjustments were required to maintain theophylline concentrations within the range of 8.2 to 27.3 micrograms / ml . possible explanations for these changes included hypoxia and medically induced starvation . daily theophylline doses ranged from 600 to 1600 mg / d . it is concluded that in some individuals , within-subject changes in theophylline clearance can be substantial , thus requiring frequent monitoring of theophylline concentration . 
suprofen-induced acute renal failure . a case report of acute flank pain with reversible renal failure in a young adult after taking three doses of suprofen is presented . blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine values returned to normal from significantly elevated levels on admission . 
cefamandole distribution in serum , adipose tissue , and wound drainage in morbidly obese patients . distribution and elimination of cefamandole 2 g iv were studied in 11 morbidly obese patients during a gastric bypass operation and again on the first postoperative day . serum , subcutaneous adipose tissue , wound drainage , and urine were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for cefamandole and pharmacokinetic parameters from the intraoperative period were compared to those obtained postoperatively . total body clearance was significantly greater ( p less than 0.001 ) postoperatively ( 297 ml / min ) than intraoperatively ( 254 ml / min ) . volume changes were unpredictable but the elimination rate constant tended to increase postoperatively . renal clearance and percentage of urinary recovery were significantly increased ( p less than 0.01 ) postoperatively . the patients had a mean ( + / - sd ) volume of the central compartment of 10.3 ( + / - 2.3 ) l , volume at steady state of 18.3 ( + / - 3.9 ) l , and elimination rate constant of 1.67 ( + / - 0.63 ) h-1 . tissue concentrations of cefamandole were highest during the first hour after drug administration and were less than 1 microgram / g after 3.5 hours . mean wound drainage concentrations ranged between 10 and 12 micrograms / ml during a dosing interval and dropped to 7 micrograms / ml 12 hours after the last dose . intraoperative dosing of cefamandole is required to maintain subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations greater than 1 microgram / g during procedures longer than three hours in morbidly obese patients . a postoperative dose of cefamandole 2 g iv q6h will provide sustained and therapeutic concentrations in the wound drainage of morbidly obese patients . 
effect of molindone on weight change in hospitalized schizophrenic patients . a retrospective review was conducted to assess the effect of molindone on weight . monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone , a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics , or other neuroleptic drugs . we found no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups . our results challenge the common opinion that molindone can be associated with a lack of weight gain compared to other antipsychotics . 
survey of the professional interrelations between dermatologist and pharmacist . a national survey of dermatologists and pharmacists was conducted to characterize the involvement of the community pharmacist in the area of skin diseases and to elicit suggestions to improve professional interrelations . the results show the dermatologists ' major complaint is pharmacists ' inability or unwillingness to compound prescriptions . the study clearly indicates the need for increased communication between the two professions in matters such as inventory control , prescription refill procedures , and substitution guidelines . the pharmacists , in general , admitted a deficiency in their educational preparedness to recognize common skin disorders , thus limiting their ability to assess the severity of patients ' complaints .

ovarian function in ewes treated with antihistamines . ewes were treated systemically during the periovulatory period with the antihistamines diphenhydramine ( h1-receptor antagonist ) and ( or ) cimetidine ( h2-receptor antagonist ) . none of the treatments prevented ovulation . however , the combination of drugs inhibited subsequent function of the corpus luteum ( cl ) as assessed by serum measurements of progesterone . administration of antihistamines did not alter pituitary secretion of lh . injection of small quantities of diphenhydramine and cimetidine into the antrum of the preovulatory follicle also caused aberrant luteal activity , but no blockade of ovulation . intrafollicular injection of histamine reversed the inhibitory influence of antihistamines on the cl . antihistamines suppressed preovulatory thecal edema and antral influx of plasma transudate containing lh . thus , the effects of antihistamines appear to have been exerted at the follicular level . function of matured cl was not compromised by peripheral administration of antihistamines . actions of histamine within the preovulatory ovine follicle do not appear to be a prerequisite for ovulation , but apparently do have an impact on ensuing luteal function . we propose that a hyperemic reaction to histamine in preovulatory follicles enhances vascular filtration of lh . as a consequence , maximal permeation of the avascular granulosal layer of the follicle by lh leads to a normal luteinization response . 
immunoglobulin and secretory component regulation in the rat uterus at the time of decidualization . to determine the effect of decidualization on uterine immunoglobulins ( igs ) , we measured the levels of igg , iga , and secretory component ( sc ) after induction of artificial decidual cell reactions ( dcr ) in hormonally primed ovariectomized rats . when progesterone-treated ( 2.5 mg / day , 3 days ) rats received an intraluminal instillation of oil or a needle scratch stimulation in one uterine horn , the stimulated horn had an increase in wet weight and cytoplasmic protein relative to the contralateral horn . under these conditions , igg levels increased 10-fold in the lumen of the stimulated horn . this response was selective for igg , because induction of dcr had no effect on accumulation of iga or sc in the stimulated horn . the progesterone-induced accumulation of igg after dcr was further enhanced by estradiol . the addition of a small amount of estradiol ( 0.2 microgram ) on day 3 of a 4-day progesterone pretreatment resulted in further increases in both the wet weight of the stimulated horn and the concentration of igg in the lumen . the amount of igg in the lumen of the stimulated horn was 5-fold greater than that in the stimulated horn after progesterone alone . levels of iga and sc , however , remained unchanged with this treatment . these results indicate that movement of igg into the uterine lumen occurs as a part of the dcr and that both an appropriate endocrine balance and physical stimulation are essential for maximal igg accumulation . further , they suggest that igg may play a central role in early pregnancy , which results in the successful implantation of the blastocysts . 
modulation of the chloride concentration of human sweat by prolactin . the purpose of this study was to determine whether the availability of prl modulates the chloride concentration of human sweat . full thickness human skin grafted into the back of immunoincompetent , nude , congenitally athymic mice heals in about 6 to 10 weeks and survives the life of the mice . mice have no sweat glands in the back so this system provides a useful model for study of the physiology and pathology of human sweat glands . the graft can be induced to sweat and the sweat collected for analytical studies . presumably normal skin obtained from 7 individuals undergoing reconstructive surgery was grafted successfully into 11 mice . on 49 occasions sweat was induced by pilocarpine iontophoresis and collected for 45 min . the chloride concentration was 12.9 + / - 6.7 meq / liter , values typical of normal human sweat . nine mice bearing grafts were injected with rabbit anti-human prl ( hprl ) . the chloride concentration of sweat obtained a day later was significantly elevated . the concentration generally increased after a second and sometimes a third injection of anti-prl . the average maximum sweat chloride obtained was 61.9 + / - 8.25 meq / liter . serum of rabbits that had not been exposed to hprl was prepared and diluted in the same way as the anti-hprl . the chloride concentration of sweat of 3 mice that received the preparation for several days remained unchanged at the low normal level . we conclude that depletion of prl increases the concentration of chloride in human sweat . 
the related genes encoding growth hormone and prolactin have been dispersed to chromosomes 10 and 17 in the rat . we have assigned the rat gh gene to chromosome 10 and the rat prl gene to chromosome 17. dna from a series of mouse bwtg3 x rat hepatocyte somatic cell hybrids , each of which has retained a unique complement of rat chromosomes , was analyzed for the presence of rat gh and prl genomic fragments by southern blotting . radiolabeled complementary dnas ( cdnas ) encoding rat gh and rat prl were used as molecular probes . based upon these assignments , we conclude that the evolutionarily related gh and prl genes have been dispersed to different chromosomes in rat as in man . 
immunocytochemical localization of estrogen receptors in the macaque endometrium during the luteal-follicular transition . we examined changes in estrogen receptors ( ers ) in endometrial stromal and epithelial cells in cynomolgus macaques during artificially induced menstruation and repair . we used silastic implants filled with either estradiol ( e2 ) or progesterone ( p ) to treat spayed animals for 14 days with e2 followed by 14 days of e2 plus p . we then withdrew the p ( but not the e2 ) implants and removed uteri 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 14 days later . uterine tissues were assayed biochemically for er content , fixed for histology and frozen for immunocytochemistry of er with monoclonal antiestrophilins . on day 0 , er levels in endometrium were low [ 1330 + / - 201 ( n = 9 ) fmol / mg dna ] . an increase in total receptor was evident by 3-4 days of p withdrawal 2762 + / - 190 ( n = 6 ) fmol / mg dna ; p less than 0.001 ] . total receptor concentrations increased linearly with time from 0.5-7 days of p withdrawal ( r = 0.88 ) . on day 0 , staining for nuclear er in the glandular epithelium and stroma of zones i , ii , and iii of the endometrium was negative . beginning at 12-24 h and continuing through 4 days of p withdrawal , nuclear staining became detectable and increased in intensity only in endometrial stromal fibroblasts and myometrial smooth muscle cells . the glandular epithelium of the endometrium did not develop nuclear staining until 5-7 days of p withdrawal , coincident with a 10-fold increase in the mitotic index of the epithelium of the upper zones . thus , the increase in endometrial er levels that occurred during the first 5 days of an induced luteal-follicular transition took place almost exclusively in stromal fibroblasts . 
in vivo effects of transcriptional and translational inhibitors on duodenal vitamin d-dependent calcium-binding protein messenger ribonucleic acid stimulation by 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol . the in vivo stimulation of vitamin d-dependent calcium-binding protein ( 9 k cabp ) synthesis by 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [ 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 ] in the rat duodenum has been analyzed using a specific [ 32p ] complementary dna probe for rat 9 k cabp and inhibitors of rna transcription ( actinomycin d , alpha-amanitin ) or protein synthesis ( cycloheximide ) . the relative amounts of 9 k cabp messenger rna ( mrna ) were assayed by dot-blot hybridization and the relative amounts of 9 k cabp by ria . both inhibitors were injected at doses which significantly inhibited by 80-95 % [ 35s ] methionine or [ 3h ] uridine incorporation into protein and rna , respectively . in vitamin d-deficient rats , a single 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 injection ( 650 pmol / 100 g bw ) resulted in a rapid production of 9 k cabp mrna which was significantly detectable as early as 3 h , and was followed by an increase of 9 k cabp levels . injection of actinomycin d ( 25 micrograms / 100 g bw ) 1 h before 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 treatment and repeated every 4 h did not prevent the hormone-induced elevation of duodenal cabp mrna , even when the actinomycin dose was doubled and given 2 h before hormonal treatment . alpha-amanitin ( 2 micrograms / 100 g bw ) also failed to block the hormonal stimulation . the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( 25 micrograms / 100 g bw ) did not cause any change in the 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3-induced cabp mrna but blocked the cabp increase after hormone injection . thus , transcription inhibitors did not prevent the in vivo hormone-induced elevation of 9 k cabp mrna , which suggests that 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 increases 9 k cabp synthesis by increasing 9 k cabp gene expression at one or more posttranscriptional steps . more precise data will be obtained by measuring the rate of 9 k cabp gene transcription on isolated nuclei from rat duodenum . 
direct effect of estradiol on the number of dopamine receptors in the anterior pituitary of ovariectomized rats . the effect of 17 beta-estradiol ( 17 beta e2 ) on anterior pituitary dopaminergic receptor ( d2 ) content was studied in vitro in relation to prl secretion . anterior pituitaries from ovariectomized rats were incubated for short periods in medium 199 , with or without the steroid . dopamine ( da ) receptors in partially purified pituitary membranes were quantified by equilibrium binding using [ 3h ] spiperone ; the prl released into the incubation medium was analyzed by ria . addition of 10 ( -10 ) to 10 ( -6 ) m 17 beta e2 to the incubation medium of anterior pituitaries rapidly and reversibly decreased the number of da receptors ( p less than 0.01 to 0.001 ) , while increasing prl release , in a dose-related fashion . the maximal effect on both receptor numbers and prl secretion was obtained with 10 ( -8 ) m 17 beta e2 . this effect involved no change in receptor affinity ( kd = 0.11 + / - 0.01 nm in presence or in absence of 17 beta e2 ) . this estrogen-induced decrease in da-binding capacity was apparently not the result of the occupation of spiperone binding sites by the steroid , since after a 30-min incubation with 10 ( -8 ) m [ 3h ] 17 beta e2 , no radioactivity was detectable on the partially purified membranes . moreover , the presence of 17 beta e2 at the same time as the labeled d2 ligand did not modify the kinetics of association or dissociation of spiperone with pituitary membranes . this decrease in anterior pituitary da receptor content and the increase in prl release were already significant after a 7-min incubation in the presence of 10 ( -8 ) m 17 beta e2 . finally , these effects of 17 beta e2 were not mimicked by its 17 alpha-stereoisomer , nor by progesterone , or testosterone . these results suggest that the stimulatory effect of 17 beta e2 on prl secretion may be due , at least in part , to the desensitization of anterior pituitary cells to da . the steroid may produce this desensitization directly by decreasing the number of d2 . the short latency of this effect likely discards the possibility of a genomic action of 17 beta e2 . 
dibutyryl adenosine cyclic monophosphate regulates differentiation of type a spermatogonia with vitamin a in adult mouse cryptorchid testis in vitro . surgically prepared cryptorchid mouse testes containing only type a spermatogonia were cultured with ( bu ) 2camp in combination with vitamin a ( retinol ) . treatment with ( bu ) 2camp and retinol for 12-24 h and with basal medium for an additional 8 days stimulated mitotic activity in type a spermatogonia and induced differentiation of germ cells . however , ( bu ) 2camp alone did not induce differentiation of type a spermatogonia . moreover , when cryptorchid testes were treated with ( bu ) 2camp for longer than 3 days in the presence or absence of retinol , differentiation of type a spermatogonia did not take place ; disintegration of the seminiferous tubules occurred instead . when the cryptorchid testes were cultured for 24 h in a medium containing a fixed concentration of retinol and varying concentrations of ( bu ) 2camp from 0.001-0.4 mm , there was a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells and type a spermatogonia . likewise , at a fixed dose of ( bu ) 2camp and increasing concentrations of retinol , a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells occurred . however , the number of type a spermatogonia was decreased . the addition of puromycin , cycloheximide , and actinomycin d to the medium completely blocked retinol- ( bu ) 2camp-induced differentiation of the germ cells . the present results suggest that camp and retinol trigger biochemical events promoting the synthesis of specific macromolecules involved in the proliferation and differentiation of type a spermatogonia . 
hypothalamic vasoactive intestinal peptide messenger ribonucleic acid is increased in lactating rats . vasoactive intestinal peptide ( vip ) has been proposed as an inducer of prl release . moreover , immunocytochemical studies suggested an increase in the vip content in the hypothalamus of lactating rats . we investigated whether this increase is regulated at the level of gene transcription . a sensitive rna detection assay that uses in vitro transcribed rna probes corresponding to specific exons of the vip gene was devised to study vip gene expression . using this method , an approximately 2000-base long rna containing the coding sequences for vip was detected in rat hypothalamus . this rna also contains the coding sequences for the vip-related peptide phm / i ( peptide histidine methionine amide or isoleucine amide ) . an identical vip-encoding rna was previously identified in the rat cerebral cortex . a 2-fold increase was observed in hypothalamic vip mrna during lactation . in addition , the levels of this mrna increased in the hypothalamus at the time of sexual maturation . taken together , our results suggest a physiological regulation of vip gene expression associated with its potential role as a neuroendocrine hormone . 
autoregulation of iodide transport in the rabbit : absence of autoregulation in fetal tissue and comparison of maternal and fetal thyroid iodination products . maternal and fetal rabbit thyroid glands were compared as to their ability to respond to excess iodide in vitro with a reduction in subsequent iodide transport activity . preincubation of maternal thyroid tissue slices for 2 h with excess iodide ( 30 microm ) resulted in a 31 % reduction in the subsequently measured thyroid-medium radioiodide concentration ratio . in contrast , similar iodide pretreatment had no significant effect on fetal iodide transport . in all other respects , fetal iodide transport , although it was 10 times higher , did not differ significantly from maternal transport activity . combined radiolabeled maternal ( 125i ) and fetal ( 131i ) rabbit thyroid tissue was eluted on sephadex g-25 columns . fractions were analyzed for both 125i and 131i activity , and the maternal to fetal ratios ( 125i / 131i ) were determined for each fraction . the majority of iodoproteins eluted with the void volume , and the 125i / 131i ratio was constant in these fractions . thereafter , two peaks of elevated 125i / 131i activity could be observed . peak a eluted below lysozyme ( mr = 14 , 300 ) and above insulin ( mr = 6 , 000 ) , with an apparent mol wt of 8 , 000 to 10 , 000. a second peak , peak b , eluted from the column at a site similar to that of mit or a protein of mr of 2 , 000. ascending paper chromatography of this latter peak of 125i / 131i activity and mit was carried out in two solvent systems . in both systems , peak b comigrated with mit . these findings suggest that the failure of fetal thyroid tissue to exhibit autoregulation may be associated with the reduced iodination of a compound with an approximate mr of 8 , 000 to 10 , 000. the role of this substance in iodide transport remains to be identified . the reason for the apparent increase in the labeling of mit observed in maternal vs . fetal tissue is unknown . 
autoregulation of thyroid iodide transport : evidence for the mediation of protein synthesis in iodide-induced suppression of iodide transport . the role of protein synthesis in iodide-induced suppression of subsequent iodide transport ( iodide autoregulation ) was studied in cat thyroid slices . thyroid slices were pretreated for 60-120 min in the presence or absence of either excess ( 30 microm ) sodium iodide , inhibitors of protein synthesis , or both . tissue was then washed in the presence of 2 mm methimazole to prevent subsequent iodination reaction and remove excess iodide . iodide transport activity was finally evaluated by measurement of the ratio of tissue to medium iodide concentrations in 90-min incubations . addition of 0.1 mm cycloheximide during the preexposure of thyroid tissue to excess iodide had no effect on either control levels of iodide transport or iodide-induced autoregulation . however , if thyroid tissue was treated with cycloheximide alone for 1 h before preexposure to excess iodide , there was a significant reduction in the degree of iodide-induced induced autoregulation . similar results were obtained with pretreatment of the tissue with 0.5 mm puromycin and 1 microgram / ml emetine . these findings suggest that protein synthesis is involved in the mechanism of thyroid autoregulation of iodide transport . cycloheximide had no effect on the ability of excess iodide to reduce tsh-stimulated camp formation . two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-isoelectric focusing and sephadex g-25 column chromatography employing dual-isotope comparison of iodoprotein labeling of control and cycloheximide-treated tissue suggest that the ability of cycloheximide to suppress iodide-induced autoregulation is associated with the reduced iodination of an 8- to 10-kilodalton soluble component of the thyroid gland . 
stimulation by 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 of adenylate cyclase along the villus of chick duodenum . administration of 650 pmol 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 [ 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 ] to vitamin d-deficient chicks increased adenylate cyclase activity in the basolateral membrane of duodenal epithelial cells within 24 h . this increase in enzymatic activity was accompanied by an increase in calmodulin content of the basolateral membrane . although neither exogenously added calmodulin ( up to 10 micrograms / ml ) nor calcium ( from 10 ( -7 ) -10 ( -5 ) m ) stimulated enzyme activity , calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine , w7 , and w13 inhibited it . when calmodulin content , adenylate cyclase activity , and alkaline phosphatase activity were measured in cells sequentially eluted from the tip to the base of the villus , cells from the midregion and base had the highest calmodulin content and adenylate cyclase activity , whereas alkaline phosphatase activity ( a brush border membrane enzyme ) was highest in cells eluted from the tip . adenylate cyclase activity was increased by 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 , particularly in cells from the midvillus . our results indicate that the response of adenylate cyclase activity to 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 varies along the villus and suggest that calmodulin may be involved . 
chronic administration of 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 : increased bone but impaired mineralization . male sprague-dawley rats were infused continuously for 13 days with vehicle or 75 pmol ( 31.2 ng ) / day 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 [ 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 ] by means of alzet osmotic minipumps implanted s.c. animals infused with 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 exhibited mild hypercalcemia ( 11.2 vs . 10.2 mg / dl in controls ) , a 136 % increase in the serum concentration of 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 ( 187 vs . 79 pg / ml ) , and a 59 % decrease in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d ( 12 vs . 29 ng / ml ) . the proximal tibial metaphysis of these animals was characterized by increased trabecular bone volume ( 15 % vs . 6.5 % ) , osteoid accumulation ( 4.2 % vs . 0.1 % ) , increased osteoblast surface and number ( 31 % and 19 / mm vs . 21 % and 14 / mm , respectively ) , and decreased osteoclast surface and number ( 11 % and 2 / mm vs . 36 % and 6 / mm , respectively ) . similar but less striking changes were seen in the lumbar vertebra . increases in the fat-free weight and calcium content of the tibia and lumbar vertebra were consistent with the increase in trabecular bone volume after 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 infusion . however , tetracycline labeling and the incorporation of 45ca in these bones were reduced by 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 infusion . in addition , mineralization lag time was prolonged in the lumbar vertebrae of 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3-infused rats . our findings indicate that chronic 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 administration increases bone mass , but at the cost of impaired bone mineralization . 
glucocorticoid-induced messenger ribonucleic acids in rat thymic lymphocytes : rapid primary effects specific for glucocorticoids . we examined the mechanism underlying the rapid ( 15-120 min ) glucocorticoid-mediated increase in the synthesis of proteins envisioned as mediators of the initial steroid effects in thymic lymphocytes . analysis of about 1500 in vitro translation products on giant two-dimensional gels revealed rapid hormonal influences on only 7 mrnas , 6 whose translation products have mol wt and pis identical to those proteins whose synthesis has been found to be increased after the addition of glucocorticoids to thymus cells . the additional mrna codes for glucocortin , whose induction in thymus as well as other target cells has been reported . mrna inductions for proteins 1 , 2 , and 1n are detectable 15-30 min after the addition of dexamethasone to isolated thymus cells and continue to increase until 2 h , whereas the mrnas for proteins 4 and 5 are not increased until after 1 h . the mrna for protein 3 is elevated by 1 h , but attempts to quantitate the change at earlier times have failed because this protein focuses poorly . the parallel between these in vitro translation results and the increased synthesis of individual proteins seen in whole cells demonstrates that increased mrna levels underlie the cellular changes . other hormones , such as estradiol , testosterone , and t3 , at 10 ( -6 ) m and deoxycorticosterone at 10 ( -8 ) m do not induce these messages . partial inductions of 1 and 2 , but not 1n , are seen with deoxycorticosterone at 10 ( -6 ) m , consistent with its classification as a partial glucocorticoid agonist . cycloheximide does not block the rise in mrna for the most rapid inductions , 1 , 2 , and 1n . the results indicate that dexamethasone rapidly and specifically induces 6 thymus cell mrnas in addition to the one coding for glucocortin . the cycloheximide results suggest that at least 3 of these represent primary steroid hormone responses . 
detection of vasoactive intestinal peptide-encoding messenger ribonucleic acid in the rat ovaries . vasoactive intestinal peptide ( vip ) has recently been detected in rat ovaries and has been shown to stimulate steroidogenesis by cultured rat granulosa cells . in this study we investigated whether the vip-messenger rna ( mrna ) can be detected in the ovaries , thus suggesting local synthesis of the peptide . to study vip-gene expression , a sensitive rna detection assay which uses in vitro transcribed rna probes corresponding to specific exons of the vip gene was developed . using this method , an approximately 2000-base rna band containing the coding sequences for vip was detected in rat ovaries . this rna also contains the coding sequences for the vip-related peptide ( peptide-histidine-methionine ) . an identical vip-encoding rna was previously identified in the rat cerebral cortex . however , the vip-mrna quantity in the cortex was 12-fold-higher as compared to the ovaries . these results may reflect the differences in vip concentration in the two organs . the finding of vip-encoding mrna in the rat ovaries suggests a local synthesis of vip in the ovaries . 
estradiol activates methylating enzyme ( s ) involved in the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine in rat pituitary membranes . 17 beta-estradiol ( e2 ) affects the sensitivity of pituitary cells to several neurohormones as lhrh , trh , or dopamine , presumably by modulating receptor coupling mechanisms . we attempted to pinpoint the membrane processes underlying this modulation and studied the effect of e2 on pituitary membrane phospholipid methylation . anterior pituitary membranes prepared from ovariectomized ( ovx ) or ovx plus e2-treated rats were assayed for phospholipid methylation . methylated phospholipids were separated by tlc . incorporation of [ 3h ] methyl groups into phospholipids increased with membrane concentration and incubation time with s-adenosyl-l-methyl [ 3h ] methionine ; it was not mg2+ dependent and was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine , methyltransferase inhibitor . ph was found to be critical . formation of phosphatidyl-monoethanolamine , phosphatidyl-dimethylethanolamine , and phosphatidylcholine was markedly stimulated by treatment with e2 . the effect increased progressively when animals were killed 15 h to 5 days after e2 implantation . the response involved a shift in the maximum velocity ( vmax ) although there was no change in the available substrate for the methylating enzyme . this change in vmax probably reflects changes in the amount of the methylating enzyme itself . administration of 17 alpha-estradiol , an inactive stereoisomer of e2 was ineffective , pointing to a stereospecific interaction . after differential centrifugation of pituitary membranes , the highest specific methyltransferase activity was found in light mitochondrial ( l ) and microsomal ( p ) fractions and the lowest in nuclei ( n ) and the heavy mitochondrial ( m ) fractions . after sucrose density gradient centrifugation , methylated phospholipids were preferentially recovered from fractions corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum and / or secretory granules . e2 treatment for 5 days did not modify the subcellular distribution of methyltransferase activity but stimulated it in all fractions ; in contrast , it did not modify the activity of the other enzymes measured as fraction markers . under the same experimental conditions , phospholipid methylation in membranes prepared from cortex , and anterior and mediobasal hypothalamic structures was not affected by the steroid , with the exception of a slight increment of [ 3h ] methyl incorporation into mediobasal hypothalamic membrane phospholipids after 5 days of e2 treatment . these results indicate that e2-induced changes in pituitary responsiveness might be concomitant with selective effects of the steroid on specific membrane enzymatic activities involved in coupling mechanisms . 
inhibition of binding of ovine placental lactogen to growth hormone and prolactin receptors by monoclonal antibodies . from a single cell fusion , five stable hybridomas secreting antiovine placental lactogen ( opl ) antibodies were obtained . three of these secrete immunoglobulin ( ig ) g subclass , and the other two secrete igm class antibodies . ascites fluids were raised in mice for each clone and were used as the antibody component for the development of solid phase ria . three solid-phase rias were successfully established using individual igg subclass monoclonal antibodies , but the igm class antibodies were ineffective . in all three individual solid-phase rias , the binding of [ 125i ] iodo-opl to the immobilized antibody was inhibited by unlabeled opl , but not by ovine pituitary prl ( oprl ) , ovine gh ( ogh ) , or ovine pituitary extract . two of the igg subclass antibodies were able to inhibit the binding of [ 125i ] iodo-opl to prl receptors ( s ) and to gh receptor ( s ) in rabbit mammary gland and liver , respectively . one of these two igg subclass antibodies was more effective at inhibiting the binding of opl to prl receptor ( s ) in rabbit mammary gland , whereas the other one is more effective in inhibiting the binding of opl to gh receptor ( s ) in rabbit liver . these antibodies , however , could only weakly inhibit the binding of [ 125i ] iodo-oprl to rabbit mammary gland and were ineffective in inhibiting the binding of [ 125i ] iodo-ogh to rabbit liver . the addition of monoclonal antibodies in both radioreceptor assay ( rra ) for prl ( rra-prl ) and for gh ( rra-gh ) did not affect the parallelism of the displacement curve of opl standard . our results suggest that opl might contain two distinct binding sequence ( s ) : one responsible for the binding of opl to prl receptor ( s ) and the other responsible for the binding of opl to gh receptor ( s ) . these two binding sequences might overlap or be located adjacent to one another . the interaction of monoclonal antibodies with these binding sequences of opl may block the binding of opl with prl and gh receptor ( s ) . alternatively , our studies suggest that the monoclonal antibodies do not bind to hormone receptor ( s ) -binding sequence ( s ) in opl , but the interaction between opl and monoclonal antibody might alter the conformational structure of the opl which will consequently lead to a lower binding of opl to prl and gh receptor ( s ) . 
calmodulin mediates the stimulatory effect of 3 , 5 , 3'-triiodothyronine on adenylate cyclase activity in rat thymocyte plasma membranes . we have previously demonstrated that t3 increases adenylate cyclase activity in rat thymocyte plasma membranes by a mechanism that is calcium dependent . in the present studies we have examined whether calmodulin participates in this response to t3 . initial experiments provided evidence that calmodulin is involved in regulating the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in this tissue . thus , compared with findings in freshly prepared membranes , dialysis of thymocyte plasma membrane preparations for 20 h at 4 c decreased their calmodulin concentrations from an initial value of approximately 600 ng / 100 micrograms protein by about 50 % and decreased adenylate cyclase activity by approximately 80 % . although storage of the same preparations under comparable conditions resulted in no change in calmodulin content , it caused an approximate 30 % decrease in adenylate cyclase activity . addition of calmodulin had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in fresh or stored membrane preparations , but produced a dose-dependent increase in enzyme activity in preparations that had been dialyzed . further , when added to freshly isolated membranes , three calmodulin antagonists , trifluoperazine , calmidazolium , and calmodulin antibodies , all produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity , and this was completely reversed in all cases by the addition of high concentrations of exogenous calmodulin . the stimulation of guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase activity that t3 induced in fresh membrane preparations was present in membranes that had been stored , but was absent in those that had been dialyzed . in addition , the response to t3 in fresh membranes was inhibited or abolished by all three calmodulin antagonists . both in dialyzed membranes and in the presence of antagonists , the response to t3 was restored by the addition of exogenous calmodulin . we conclude that calmodulin influences the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in rat thymocytes and ultimately mediates the stimulation of enzyme activity that t3 produces . such mediation very likely explains the calcium-dependent nature of the stimulatory effect of t3 on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity . 
osteoblastic insufficiency is responsible for maintenance of osteopenia after loss of ovarian function in experimental beagle dogs . bone loss developing after cessation of ovarian function in humans represents a major health problem . to establish the value of ovariohysterectomy in female beagle dogs as a model for bone loss and to study static and dynamic parameters of bone associated with the negative bone balance occurring after cessation of ovarian function , we performed iliac crest bone biopsies before and 4 months after ovariohysterectomy in eight beagle dogs and in five sham-operated controls . cessation of ovarian function was documented by an increase in serum levels of lh 4 weeks after ovariohysterectomy . there was no change in serum calcium , phosphorus , and creatinine during the 4 months of the study . cancellous bone mass and trabecular mean wall thickness decreased significantly after ovariohysterectomy ( p less than 0.01 ) . in addition , the number of osteoblasts was increased and the bone formation rate per osteoblast , that is , the activity of bone-forming cells , was decreased ( p less than 0.01 ) . parameters of bone resorption were not significantly altered in the animals with ovariohysterectomy . no changes in histomorphometric parameters of bone structure , formation or resorption were observed in the sham-operated controls . these data indicate that ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs may serve as a useful model for bone loss associated with cessation of ovarian function . osteoblastic insufficiency appears to play a major role in the maintenance of bone loss occurring after ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs . 
growth hormone-secretory patterns in androgen-resistant ( testicular feminized ) rats . to investigate the role of androgen receptors in the expression of the male gh-secretory pattern in adult rats , the gh-secretory patterns in androgen-resistant ( testicular feminized ) rats were compared with their normal male and female littermates . all animals were prepared with intraatrial silastic catheters and bled every 15 min for 8 h ( 0800-1600 h ) . normal male littermates displayed a characteristic low frequency , high amplitude pattern of gh secretion with bursts of gh occurring every 2.5-3 h and separated by prolonged trough periods where gh values remained low or undetectable ( less than 5 ng / ml ) for 45-90 min . normal female littermates showed a characteristic high frequency , low amplitude pattern of gh secretion with pulses of gh occurring every hour . compared to normal male littermates , females had lower individual gh peak amplitudes and shortened gh-trough periods which contain higher gh levels . gh-secretory profiles displayed by testicular-feminized animals qualitatively and quantitatively resembled those of the normal female littermates . these data suggest that androgen receptors are necessary for the expression of masculine gh-secretory patterns . 
antiestrogen action in the medial basal hypothalamus and pituitary of immature female rats : insights concerning relationships among estrogen , dopamine , and prolactin . we have examined the effects of nonsteroidal antiestrogens ( aes ) and estradiol ( e ) on dopamine ( da ) levels and turnover rates in the medial basal hypothalamus ( mbh ) and on serum and pituitary prl to gain insight into da-prl-e / ae interrelationships . in 21-day-old female rats , e was found to increase mbh da levels and turnover and serum prl concentrations in a time- and concentration-dependent manner . changes were observed by 1 day , and after 3 days of e treatment ( 1 microgram / day ) , mbh da levels increased 2-fold ( to 1300 pg / mg tissue ) , and da turnover rates increased 5-fold ( to 1170 pg / mg tissue . h ) . the aes tamoxifen , monohydroxytamoxifen , ci628 , and ly117018 ( 50 micrograms / day for 3 days ) weakly stimulated uterine weight gain and significantly suppressed the uterotropic action of e . the aes ly117018 , monohydroxytamoxifen , ci628 , and tamoxifen competed with e for binding to the mbh estrogen receptor and displayed relative binding affinities of 190 % , 185 % , 6.7 % , and 1.4 % , with e set at 100 % ; these affinities are similar to those found for uterine estrogen receptors . the aes increased da turnover rates only 2-fold , and they antagonized the e-induced 5-fold increase in da turnover rates very successfully . in animals treated with bromocriptine , e and ae failed to increase the low serum prl levels , yet they evoked significant ( approximately 2-fold ) increases in da turnover rates and nearly 2-fold increases in mbh da content . hence , a part of the actions of e and ae on mbh da appears to be exerted independently of changes in circulating prl and may occur by direct action of these compounds on the estrogen receptor system present in the mbh . in addition , these studies reveal that aes behave as partial estrogen agonists / antagonists in terms of their effects on mbh da turnover . 
differences in the metabolic clearance of pituitary and serum thyrotropin ( tsh ) derived from euthyroid and hypothyroid rats : effects of chemical deglycosylation of pituitary tsh . we compared the mcr , volume of distribution , and rapid phase ( rt1 / 2 ) and slow phase half-lives of purified pituitary rat ( r ) tsh , tsh from crude pituitary extracts of normal and hypothyroid rats , tsh from hypothyroid rat sera , and tsh secreted from hypothyroid rat pituitaries incubated in vitro . for 3 h after iv bolus injection into euthyroid rats , 125i-labeled rtsh was determined by acid precipitation in serum and various organs , and unlabeled tsh was measured by ria . the mcr of tsh from normal pituitary extracts ( 0.53 + / - 0.02 ml / min ) was similar to that of unlabeled purified rtsh ( 0.52 + / - 0.03 ) , while those from hypothyroid pituitary extracts ( 0.32 + / - 0.03 ) and hypothyroid sera ( 0.33 + / - 0.01 ) were decreased . the reduced mcr of tsh from hypothyroid pituitaries was due to a decreased distribution volume ( 8.4 + / - 0.6 ml ) compared to that from normal pituitaries ( 11.4 + / - 0.7 ) and hypothyroid sera ( 10.9 + / - 0.8 ) . the decreased mcr of circulating tsh from hypothyroid sera reflected an increase in its rt1 / 2 ( 12.6 + / - 0.5 min ) vs . that from both normal ( 5.1 + / - 0.5 ) and hypothyroid ( 5.7 + / - 0.4 ) pituitaries . the rt1 / 2 of secreted tsh from incubated hypothyroid rat pituitaries ( 8.5 + / - 0.9 ) was intermediate between those of circulating and pituitary forms of hypothyroid rtsh . the clearances of intact bovine tsh ( btsh ) and deglycosylated btsh ( dg-btsh ) were compared . the dg-btsh mcr was found to be increased ( 0.71 + / - 0.02 ml / min ) compared to that of btsh ( 0.59 + / - 0.02 ) , primarily due to a decreased rt1 / 2 for dg-btsh ( 3.8 + / - 0.1 min ) vs . btsh ( 4.7 + / - 0.2 ) . uptake of purified [ 125i ] rtsh was highest in the kidney at all times , varying from 43 % of the injected dose at 5 min to 54 % at 180 min . we conclude that in the euthyroid rat , 1 ) the metabolic clearance of tsh differs between pituitary and serum forms and appears to depend on specific molecular features that vary with the physiological state of the animal from which the tsh is derived ; 2 ) since chemical deglycosylation increased the clearance of tsh , we speculate that the chemical basis for changes in tsh clearance may be related to alterations in its carbohydrate structure ; and 3 ) for normal pituitary tsh , the kidney is the major organ of clearance . 
intracranial sites regulating the biphasic action of progesterone in estrogen-primed golden hamsters . diencephalic and mesencephalic neural sites regulating the biphasic effect of progesterone ( p ) were investigated using the hormone implantation technique in ovariectomized female golden hamsters primed with estrogen . double barreled cannulae were implanted unilaterally and bilaterally in the medial preoptic area , anterior hypothalamus , ventromedial hypothalamus ( vmh ) , central gray , or interpeduncular nucleus . testing was conducted using a sequential paradigm ; facilitation tests commenced after 44 h of estrogen priming . p-filled cannulae placed in the vmh region facilitated lordosis behavior in 42 % and 60 % of unilaterally and bilaterally implanted females , respectively . in the anterior hypothalamus , only p implants adjacent to the vmh area effectively promoted receptivity . lordosis behavior was also observed in 20-36 % of females with p implants in the medial preoptic area . p implants in central gray and interpeduncular nucleus regions had no significant facilitating effect on sexual behavior . tests for inhibition occurred 24 h after facilitation testing and consisted of a pretest , followed by systemic p administration and a behavioral test 4-5 h later . during the pretest for inhibition , females that were receptive in the facilitation test attacked males more rapidly than previously nonreceptive animals and showed decrements in lordosis scores after systemic p delivery . this biphasic effect of p completely inhibited receptivity among several animals in the vmh group . additional experiments , however , investigating the biphasic effect of p implants in the vmh suggested that the occurrence of copulation in the facilitation test may have been involved in mediating the subsequent increase in aggressive behavior and the suppression of sexual responsiveness in the inhibition test . nevertheless , a final experiment showed that when p was implanted sequentially in the vmh , facilitation and , more importantly , a later reduction in lordosis behavioral scores occurred even when copulation was eliminated in the facilitation test . p implants in mesencephalic regions exerted no significant inhibitory effect on receptivity . these findings demonstrate that the biphasic action of p in the female hamster is regulated by nerve cells located in the diencephalon , especially in the vmh region . 
energy-dependent uptake of 3 , 5 , 3'-triiodo-l-thyronine in rat skeletal muscle . the uptake of [ 125i ] t3 in rat skeletal muscle was investigated by incubating intact soleus muscles with a tracer amount of [ 125i ] t3 . at 37 c [ 125i ] t3 uptake increased asymptotically ; at 60 min the muscle contained 10 % of the total [ 125i ] t3 or 0.238 + / - 0.021 % per mg wet tissue . at 0 c the [ 125i ] t3 uptake was 1 / 5 of that at 37 c . the specific [ 125i ] t3 uptake , determined by subtracting the uptake in the presence of 10 microm unlabeled t3 from the total [ 125i ] t3 uptake , attained a plateau after 60 min . washout experiments , done by first incubating the muscle for 60 min at 37 c or 0 c with [ 125i ] t3 and then at 0 c for 3 h with unlabeled t3 , showed that 21 + / - 2 % or 58 + / - 4 % of the radioactivity , respectively , was released , indicating an intracellular location of the hormone after incubation at 37 c . addition of increasing concentrations of l-t3 , d-t3 and l-t4 caused a progressive inhibition of the [ 125i ] t3 uptake ; the 50 % inhibitory concentrations being 400 nm , 7 microm , and more than 15 microm , respectively . preincubation of soleus muscles with metabolic inhibitors almost completely inhibited [ 125i ] t3 specific uptake , with oligomycin and antimycin causing 98 + / - 4 % and 81 + / - 3 % reduction , respectively . monodansylcadaverine and bacitracin , inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis , reduced the specific [ 125i ] t3 uptake in a dose-dependent manner up to 67 + / - 3 % and 62 + / - 2 % , respectively . these results indicate the presence of a saturable , stereospecific , and energy-dependent process responsible , at least in part , for t3 uptake in rat skeletal muscle . this specific t3 uptake may be a receptor-mediated endocytosis process . 
effects of 17 beta-estradiol on angiotensin ii receptors and prolactin release in cultured pituitary cells . angiotensin ii ( aii ) binds to specific receptors in the lactotroph and stimulates prl secretion from isolated rat pituitary cells . since estrogens exert major regulatory actions on prl secretion , the effects of estradiol ( e2 ) on pituitary aii receptors and prl responses were studied in vivo and in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells . in female rats , treatment with e2-containing silastic capsules for 4 days caused a significant increase in pra from 1.3 to 3 ng / ml x min and a 38 % decrease in the binding of [ 125i ] aii to anterior pituitary membrane-rich fractions ( p less than 0.01 ) . in vitro studies showed that treatment of cultured anterior pituitary cells with 1 nm e2 for 4 days caused a 57 + / - 6 % decrease in aii receptor concentration with no change in binding affinity . reduction of aii receptors by e2 in 4-day cultures was dose dependent and was demonstrable with e2 concentrations that occur in plasma during the estrous cycle ( 0.01-1 nm ) . the decrease in aii receptors in cells incubated with 1 nm e2 was near maximum after 24 h of culture , and results were similar when receptor concentrations were calculated per unit protein or per cell . despite the substantial decrease in aii receptors , e2 treatment did not specifically decrease the responsiveness of the pituitary cells to aii stimulation . thus , prl responses to aii ( 10 nm ) or trh ( 100 nm ) were unchanged after 1 day of e2 treatment and were increased after 4 days of treatment . these findings demonstrate that e2 has a direct inhibitory action on expression of pituitary aii receptors that is not accompanied by a decrease in aii-stimulated prl secretion . in the rat pituitary , estrogen modulation of postreceptor events is the predominant determinant of lactotroph responsiveness during stimulation of prl release by aii . 
processing and estrogen regulation of the 52-kilodalton protein inside mcf7 breast cancer cells . a 52k glycoprotein is secreted by human breast cancer cells in culture after estrogen stimulation . using monoclonal antibodies , we have quantitated and characterized the corresponding proteins of the cell compartment . using pulse-chase experiments , we have shown that about 40 % of the 52k protein is secreted , the majority being successively processed into a 48k and a 34k protein . this last protein is very stable . the processing is inhibited by lysosomotropic agents and leupeptin , suggesting that it occurs in acidic vesicles , such as lysosomes or endosomes . estradiol increased the intracellular level of immunoreactive 52k related proteins by 4-fold . its effect is , however , more obvious in the medium , since there is a constitutive level in the cell . the stimulatory effects of estradiol on [ 3h ] mannose and [ 35s ] methionine incorporation into these proteins were similar and the endoglycosydase h sensitivity of the proteins was not altered , suggesting that estradiol did not modulate the glycosylation step . antiestrogens did not stimulate synthesis and glycosylation of the 52k related proteins . estradiol also increased the stability of the 52k precursor as well as that of total proteins . we conclude that the secreted 52k protein is the precursor of two cellular proteins of 48k and 34k . estradiol stimulates both the intracellular accumulation of these proteins and the secretion of the precursor . 
structure-activity relationships of sex steroid analogs determined in vitro in a thyroid hormone-responsive membrane ca2+-atpase model . physiological concentrations of l-t4 were found previously to stimulate ca2+-atpase activity in vitro in reticulocyte membranes from female rabbits and to inhibit this enzyme in reticulocyte membranes from males . in these previous studies , preincubation of intact cells or ghosts with testosterone ( 5 x 10 ( -11 ) m ) converted female-source reticulocyte membranes to male-type responsiveness to thyroid hormone ( inhibition of ca2+-atpase activity ) . preincubation of reticulocyte membranes with 17 beta-estradiol ( 5 x 10 ( -11 ) m ) converted male-source membranes to female-type responsiveness ( stimulation by l-t4 of membrane ca2+-atpase activity ) . using this sex steroid-sensitive thyroid hormone-dependent membrane enzyme system , we investigated the structure-activity relationships of analogs of sex steroids and unrelated steroids . 5 beta-androstanes were active compared to testosterone in assays using female-source membranes , while 5 alpha-androstanes were less active . within the 5 beta-androstanes , activity was dependent on at least one hydroxyl group at the c3- or c17-position . nongonadal steroids tested were less active , establishing specificity of the sex steroid effect in assays using female-source membranes . assayed in male-source membranes , estrone and 3-hydroxy-1 , 3 , 5- ( 10 ) 7-estratraen-17-one ( equilin ) were active compared for estrogen effect with 17 beta-estradiol , while estriol was less active . the activities of hydrocortisone and aldosterone were 76 % and 71 % , respectively , in this system . these structure-activity relationships are distinct from those described for gonadal steroid-cytoplasmic binding proteins or nuclear interactions , and represent a novel sex steroid-thyroid hormone effect on activity of a membrane enzyme . 
calcium ion and cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5'-monophosphate regulate proopiomelanocortin messenger ribonucleic acid levels in rat intermediate and anterior pituitary lobes . the role of the second messengers camp and ca++ in the control of proopiomelanocortin ( pomc ) gene expression was investigated with the use of hybridization with cloned complementary dna probes . the effects of camp-related drugs on pomc messenger rna ( mrna ) levels were assessed in primary cultures of intermediate ( il ) and anterior rat pituitary cells maintained in serum-free medium . 8-bromo-camp ( 1 mm ) , but not 8-bromo-cgmp ( 1 mm ) , induced a 2-fold increase in il and anterior lobe cell after 2 days of treatment . a similar increase was obtained with the adenylate cyclase-activating drugs forskolin ( 1 microm ) and cholera toxin ( 100 ng / ml ) or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor ro 20-1724 ( 100 microm ) . at 48 h , all these treatments had increased beta-endorphin accumulation in the medium and transiently decreased the cellular beta-endorphin content in il cells , suggesting a parallel effect of camp-related drugs on secretion and biosynthesis . incubating the cells with the ca++ channel antagonists d600 ( 50 microm ) , verapamil ( 50 microm ) , and the dihydropyridine nifedipine ( 0.1 microm ) decreased basal pomc mrna levels , whereas the dihydropyridine bayk 8644 ( 0.1 microm ) , which activates the ca++ channel , increased pomc mrna levels after 2 days . in addition , nifedipine decreased the stimulatory effect of forskolin , whereas bayk 8644 further stimulated the forskolin-increased pomc mrna levels in il cells . we conclude that both ca++ and camp may regulate the gene expression of pomc . 
the role of calcium in prolactin release from the pituitary of a teleost fish in vitro . the release of prl from the pituitary of a teleost fish , the tilapia ( oreochromis mossambicus ) , has been previously shown to be dependent on calcium . however , the source ( s ) and specific action ( s ) of calcium in the secretory process have not been identified . also undefined are the mechanisms by which regulators of prl cell function may alter calcium distribution . in the present investigation , the elevation of medium k+ concentration during static incubations to a depolarizing concentration ( 56 mm ) produced no change in cumulative prl release over control levels during the 18-20 h of incubation . during perifusion incubation , exposure to high k+ concentrations briefly stimulated ( less than or equal to 10 min ) and then depressed prl release . in contrast , reduced medium osmotic pressure elicited a rapid elevation in prl release that was sustained for 2 h or more . d600 , a calcium entry blocker , at 10 ( -5 ) m diminished the k+-induced pulses of prl release . the same concentration , however , did not alter the release of prl evoked by reduced osmotic pressure . in contrast , cocl2 , which blocks a range of calcium-mediated processes in addition to calcium influx , suppressed prl release during perifusion and static incubations in hyposmotic medium . these findings suggest that while prl secretion from the tilapia pituitary is calcium dependent , calcium entry through voltage-regulated plasmalemma channels may not be a prerequisite to the actions of reduced osmotic pressure . 
maternal melatonin communicates daylength to the fetus in djungarian hamsters . daylength ( photoperiod ) influences the rate of reproductive development in the juveniles of some photoperiodic species . recent studies show that daylength during the prenatal period is perceived by the fetus and that this perception can profoundly influence postnatal reproductive and somatic development . using the photoperiodic djungarian hamster , we assessed the role of the maternal pineal gland and its hormone , melatonin , in this prenatal perception of daylength . maternal pinealectomy eliminated the influence of prenatal photoperiod on testicular and body weights of male pups , suggesting that a product from the maternal pineal gland communicates daylength to the fetus . infusion of the pineal hormone melatonin into pinealectomized dams for various durations during gestation mimicked the effect of varying the prenatal photoperiod on both testicular and body weights . these results indicate that pineal melatonin is involved in this novel form of communication from mother to fetus . 
suppression by 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 of transcription of the pre-proparathyroid hormone gene . when bovine parathyroid cells in culture are exposed to the active vitamin d metabolite 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 , a significant decrease in the steady-state levels of pre-proparathyroid hormone ( pre-propth ) mrna occurs . the possibility that the fall in specific mrna is due to a decrease in rate of transcription of the pth gene was examined in this study . in the presence of 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 , there was a rapid and steady decline in pth gene transcription rate which fell to a minimum of 10-15 % of control at 24 h . the effect was observed at physiological levels ( 10 ( -11 ) m ) and was also fully reversible . 
a novel bioassay for lactogenic activity : demonstration that prolactin cells differ from one another in bio- and immuno-potencies of secreted hormone . a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for detecting casein release from individual mammary cells in culture was developed as a bioassay for prl . treatment with rat prl caused dose-related increases in the percentage of mammary cells that released casein and the average size of casein plaques that formed . the assay exhibited exquisite sensitivity ( 156 fg rat prl per assay slide ) and could be used to evaluate the biopotency of prl released from individual cells . by combining this " plaque bioassay " with a standard plaque assay for measuring the secretion of immunoreactive prl , it was possible to compare the bio- and immuno-potencies of hormone released from the same pituitary cells . the results of three separate studies revealed major differences among prl secretors in these potency estimates . given the existence of prl variants with different biological and immunological efficacies , these findings suggest that prl cells differ from one another in the molecular form ( s ) of hormone released . 
purification and immunological characterization of the rat liver insulin-like growth factor-ii receptor . rat liver microsomal insulin-like growth factor-ii ( igf-ii ) receptor has been purified to homogeneity using a single step affinity chromatographic procedure on agarose-igf-ii with elution at ph 4. determined by either igf-ii binding or a direct ria for receptor , purification of 2000-fold was obtained . the mean recovery was 28 % for five such preparations . sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis and autoradiography of purified receptor , radioiodinated receptor , and affinity-labeled receptor all indicated a molecular mass of approximately 250k . scatchard analysis of igf-ii binding to purified receptor , solubilized microsomal membranes , or plasma membranes showed a single class of binding site with an affinity constant of 6 x 10 ( 10 ) liter / mol in all cases . potent antibodies to the purified receptor were raised in rabbits , capable of inhibiting 50 % of igf-ii binding at dilutions of 1 : 170 , 000 and also of fully precipitating igf-ii-prelabeled receptor at 1 : 50 , 000. both types of antibodies reacted with igf-ii receptors in rat adipose tissue , brain , heart , kidney , lung , and spleen . however , little cross-reactivity was seen with other species . comparison of the ability of receptor antibodies to inhibit igf-ii binding to microsomal and plasma membranes indicated a specific immunological difference between the igf-ii receptors in the two membrane preparations . 
structures of high-mannose oligosaccharides of mouse thyrotropin : differential processing of alpha- versus beta-subunits of the heterodimer . we have determined the structures of high mannose ( man ) oligosaccharide units of the alpha- and beta-subunits of mouse tsh heterodimers and of free alpha-subunits . mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue , or pituitaries from euthyroid or hypothyroid mice , were incubated with d- [ 2-3h ] man , homogenized , and incubated in the presence or absence of ph 3 buffer to dissociate heterodimers . highly enriched tsh beta-subunits , or tsh heterodimers , were obtained using anti-tsh beta serum and free alpha-subunits were subsequently obtained using anti-lh alpha-serum . high man units released by endoglycosidase h were analyzed by paper chromatography . at 1 and 3 h oligosaccharides with 8 or 9 man residues predominated in all subunits . in all three tissue types , units with 9 man tended to accumulate in tsh beta-subunits , whereas man-trimming from man9glcnac to man8glcnac proceeded more rapidly in tsh alpha-subunits , and in free alpha-subunits . the rate of tsh beta-subunit processing was also a function of tissue type ; the rate in euthyroid pituitary tissue equaled that in tumor tissue and was greater than that in hypothyroid pituitary tissue , suggesting that processing may be physiologically regulated . hypothyroid calf serum slowed tsh alpha-subunit processing in euthyroid pituitaries . thus , the previously reported slower processing of man9glcnac to man8glcnac in heterodimers as compared to free alpha-subunits is in large part due to accumulation of man9glcnac in tsh beta-subunits . 
redistribution of ovarian blood flow after injection of human chorionic gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone in the adult pseudopregnant rat . it is well known that lh and human cg ( hcg ) induce an increase in total ovarian blood flow . the effect of lh / hcg on luteal blood flow , however , is unknown . this work studies the effect of hcg on both luteal and ovarian blood flows at different stages of pseudopregnancy in adult female rats . pseudopregnancy was induced by mating with sterile male rats . the length of pseudopregnancy was 13 + / - 1 days and , during this time , blood flow was measured by the injection of radioactive microspheres during anesthesia . at autopsy , the corpora lutea were identified and extirpated under a stereomicroscope . these , and the remaining ovary , were then counted for radioactivity and the blood flow was calculated . progesterone levels were determined in plasma and ovarian tissues . furthermore , the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase was tested in ovarian tissues at day 6 of pseudopregnancy . an intraarterial injection of hcg ( 50 iu ) or vehicle ( saline ) was given 20 min before the blood flow determinations in anesthetized rats . the luteal blood flow was not changed by hcg on days 2 , 6 , and 11 of pseudopregnancy , whereas in the remaining ovary the blood flow increased more than 2-fold , thereby resulting in redistribution of the blood flow . ten micrograms of nih-lh-b9 , tested at day 6 of pseudopregnancy , mimicked the effect of hcg . at day 6 of pseudopregnancy , hcg ( 50 iu ) was given ip to conscious rats 200 min and 24 h before blood flow determinations . at 200 min after hcg there was a more pronounced redistribution of ovarian blood flow with a 45 % reduction in luteal blood flow and a 4-fold increase in flow through the remaining ovary . lh as well as hcg doubled the progesterone content of the remaining ovary . in the corpora lutea an increased progesterone content was seen after 200 min of hcg exposure . at 24 h after hcg injection , all parameters had returned to control levels except that adenylate cyclase was nonresponsive . the increase in the total ovarian blood flow coincides with the increased steroidogenesis and these effects are likely due to release of metabolites and / or vasoactive substances . despite this increase , the blood flow of the corpus luteum was not increased rendering vascular mechanisms unlikely as a part of the acute lh / hcg effects on corpus luteum of pseudopregnancy . 
the type ii insulin-like growth factor ( igf ) receptor has low affinity for igf-i analogs : pleiotypic actions of igfs on myoblasts are apparently mediated by the type i receptor . we have characterized binding and several actions of the somatomedins [ insulin-like growth factors i and ii ( igf-i and igf-ii ) ] on l6 myoblasts . both igf-i and igf-ii are potent stimulators of amino acid uptake , cell proliferation , and differentiation ; they also suppress protein degradation in these cells . in all measurements , the relative potencies are igf-i greater than igf-ii greater than insulin . two recombinant dna-produced analogs of igf-i , ( thr59 ) igf-i and ( n-met ) igf-i , were as active as native igf-i in all four assays . however , when 125i-labeled hormones were used for studies of binding to igf receptors , there was a striking difference between the native and recombinant igf-i molecules . both were bound significantly by the type i receptor ( a 350k molecule that is dissociated upon sulfhydryl reduction ) , but the recombinant analogs exhibited little cross-reactivity with the type ii receptor ( a 220k molecule that is not dissociated by reduction ) . thus , the equal activity of native igf-i and its recombinant dna-produced analogs coupled with the higher potency of igf-i ( compared to igf-ii ) suggest that the type ii receptor plays little or no role in the four actions of the somatomedins studied in l6 myoblasts . 
constitutive steroidogenesis in the r2c leydig tumor cell line is maintained by the adenosine 3 ' , 5'-cyclic monophosphate-independent production of a cycloheximide-sensitive factor that enhances mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis . these studies were designed to characterize constitutive steroidogenesis in leydig tumor cells . constitutive steroidogenesis was investigated by comparing constitutively active r2c leydig tumor cells to trophic hormone-responsive ma-10 leydig tumor cells . unlike the ma-10 cells , r2c cells appeared to synthesize steroid hormones independently of the camp-protein kinase pathway . although the adenylate cyclase of r2c cells could be stimulated in the expected manner by cholera toxin , camp concentrations in these cells were low , and r2c cell steroidogenesis could be dissociated from other camp-dependent processes . two camp-dependent processes in steroidogenic cells , protein kinase activation and lactate formation , showed low basal activities in r2c cells and could be stimulated by ( bu ) 2camp with a dose dependence similar to that detected in ma-10 cells . steroid hormone biosynthesis parallelled these other camp-dependent processes in ma-10 cells , but not in r2c cells . cycloheximide , however , caused similar dose-dependent inhibition of steroidogenesis in both the r2c and ma-10 cells . using a cell component bioassay , it was shown that r2c cells constitutively synthesize an extramitochondrial cycloheximide-sensitive factor that is functionally identical to the factor produced in response to hcg in ma-10 cells . this factor enhanced mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis . thus , constitutive steroidogenesis in r2c cells could be explained by the camp-independent but cycloheximide-sensitive constitutive production of an extramitochondrial factor that activated mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis . 
dexamethasone inhibition of hydrogen peroxide-stimulated glucose transport . although an action of corticosteroids to inhibit glucose transport is well known , the mechanism by which this is brought about has been unclear . some evidence has suggested an action on insulin receptors , but a postbinding or postreceptor effect has also been reported . as hydrogen peroxide acts at a postbinding site to stimulate glucose transport , studies were carried out in 3t3-l1 fibroblasts to determine whether corticosteroids would inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced glucose transport . in this cell type , both insulin and hydrogen peroxide produced a marked increase in glucose transport after a 30-min incubation . the increase produced by hydrogen peroxide , as well as insulin , was inhibited by previous incubation of the cells with dexamethasone . these findings give further support to the conclusion that dexamethasone has effects on glucose transport at a postbinding site . as changes in membrane lipids influence the movement and / or activity of glucose transporters , and dexamethasone alters membrane lipids , dexamethasone-induced changes in the lipids of the plasma membrane may be important in the mediation of the steroid effect upon glucose transport . 
partial characterization of a somatomedin-like peptide from the medium of cultured rat sertoli cells . a peptide that is recognized by antibodies to human somatomedin-c / insulin-like growth factor i ( sm-c / igf-i ) has been partially purified from cultured sertoli cells prepared from sexually immature rats . the mol wt of this peptide is about 25 , 000 , as determined by gel filtration chromatography and immunoblot analysis of samples resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . isoelectric focusing indicated that the isoelectric point of this peptide was near neutrality . however , a smaller peptide of mol wt 8 , 000 that cross-reacted with antibodies to sm-c / igf-i , was released after gel filtration in acetic acid . similarly , reverse phase hplc on a c18 column under acidic conditions released a sm-c / igf-i immunoreactive peptide of 8 , 000 mol wt . this smaller species apparently resulted from the dissociation of this peptide from a binding protein . unlike the larger neutral form , the isoelectric point of the smaller peptide was 9.8 . this pi is similar to the gh-dependent sm-c / igf-i peptide isolated from rat serum . the small peptide , unlike the larger form , reacted in a parallel manner to human sm-c / igf-i in the sm-c / igf-i ria and radioreceptor assays . in addition , the 8 , 000 mol wt peptide behaved as a progression factor in the balb / c-3t3 assay and competed with [ 125i ] sm-c / igf-i for binding to the type i sm-c / igf-i receptor from cultured rat sertoli cells . in summary , results of this study demonstrate that rat sertoli cells in culture secrete a peptide that is the rat equivalent of human sm-c / igf-i . 
secretion of proliferin . proliferin ( plf ) is a member of the prl-gh family whose mrna has been detected in proliferating mouse cells in culture and in mouse placenta . suspensions of murine placental tissue have been shown to produce plf detectable by immunoprecipitation . here we report that plf is secreted as a heterogeneous glycoprotein by growing mouse cell lines and placental tissue and that the first 29 amino acids of the preprotein serve as a signal peptide . placental plf is immunologically distinguishable from the 2 previously described mouse placental lactogens . 
differential activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase in zones of the adrenal cortex . cholesterol metabolism and steroidogenesis in the outer ( zona fasciculata / glomerulosa ) and inner ( zona reticularis ) zones of the adrenal cortex were examined in the guinea pig . it is known from previous studies that the content of cholesterol in the inner zone is considerably lower than that in the outer zone , although basal low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) receptor activity is similar in the two zones . to further explore cholesterol metabolism in the guinea pig adrenal cortex , the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a ( hmg-coa ) reductase , the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis , has been examined for which this paper forms the initial report . it was found that the basal specific activity of hmg-coa reductase was similar in the outer and inner adrenocortical zones ( approximately 230 pmol mevalonate formed / min x mg microsomal protein ) . the administration of acth caused 4- and 5-fold increases in hmg-coa reductase activity in the outer and inner zones , respectively . in fact , the increase in hmg-coa reductase activity with acth treatment was always greater for the inner zone than for the outer zone . this is in contrast to ldl receptor activity , which does not increase in the inner zone as it does in the outer zone with acth treatment . when dexamethasone was administered , hmg-coa reductase activity decreased in the outer zone by about 50 % , while there was no change in reductase activity in the inner zone . the latter finding is similar to what happens with ldl receptor activity during dexamethasone administration . why suppression of endogenous acth had no effect on hmg-coa reductase activity in the inner zone while exogenous acth administration caused a marked increase in enzyme activity is not clear , but may be related to phosphorylation / dephosphorylation mechanisms . based on the use of sodium fluoride in solutions to block hmg-coa reductase phosphatase , evidence is presented which indicates that a pharmacological dose of acth alters the phosphorylation / dephosphorylation status of hmg-coa reductase in the inner adrenocortical zone , but not in the outer cortical zone . 
species-specific processing of prodynorphin in the posterior pituitary of mammals . the steady state levels of the prodynorphin-derived opioid peptides , dynorphin a , dynorphin b , and alpha-neo-endorphin , have been extensively studied in the magnocellular / posterior pituitary system of the rat . to determine whether the rat system serves as a general model for prodynorphin processing in the mammalian posterior pituitary , we examined the steady state levels of prodynorphin-derived opioid peptides in the posterior pituitary systems of representatives of three diverse orders of mammals : guinea pig ( order rodentia ) , pig ( order artiodactyla ) , and rhesus monkey ( order primates ) . in each species studied there was evidence for species-specific deviations from the rat model . the most pronounced differences were observed with respect to the conversion of dynorphin a- ( 1-17 ) to dynorphin a- ( 1-8 ) . in rodents , rats , and guinea pigs , under steady state conditions , the molar ratios of these forms are approximately 1 : 2 and 2.5 : 1 , respectively . however , in the pig and rhesus monkey , the molar ratios of these forms are 10 : 1 and 14 : 1 , respectively . thus , under steady state conditions , the conversion of dynorphin a- ( 1-17 ) to dynorphin a- ( 1-8 ) appears to be a minor event in porcine and rhesus monkey posterior pituitary . species-specific variations were also observed with respect to the steady state levels of alpha-neo-endorphin and dynorphin b- ( 1-13 ) . in addition , the results of these studies suggest that the conversion of prodynorphin-derived opioids to leu-enkephalin probably represents a minor event in the species studied . 
postnatal development of pituitary lactotropes in the rat measured by reverse hemolytic plaque assay . developmental changes and sexual differences in the lactotrope population were studied with a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for detection and measurement of prl secretion from individual cells in conjunction with prl immunocytochemistry ( icc ) . pituitary glands from both sexes at different ages were monodispersed with 0.1 % trypsin . freshly dispersed cells were incubated in cunningham chambers for measurement of the fraction of plaque-forming cells and the size of plaques formed , or attached to glass slides for measurement of the fraction of cells staining for prl by icc . the percentage of plaque-forming cells in both sexes gradually increased with age from about 5 % of the total anterior pituitary cell population at 5 days of age to the adult levels of about 54 % in the females at proestrus and about 37 % in the males . sexual differences in the percentage of plaque-forming cells were consistently seen at 40 days of age and thereafter . the mean size of plaques in both sexes also increased with age from about 1 , 100 microns 2 at 5 days of age to a peak level of about 15 , 600 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 6 , 700 microns 2 in the males at 60 days of age ; then fell to the adult levels of about 5 , 500 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 3 , 200 microns 2 in males . sexual differences first appeared at 40 days of age and were estrogen-dependent . the results from icc closely matched those from the plaque assay , except at 5 days of age and in the adult males . at 5 days , the fraction of cells staining for prl was twice that of cells forming plaques . in adult male rats there were about 47 % immunostained prl cells but only about 39 % plaque-forming cells . this difference , however , disappeared after estrogen treatment . these results demonstrate that sexual differences in the lactotrope population develop around puberty in rats and appear to be estrogen dependent . 
effects of early pregnancy and acute 17 beta-estradiol administration on porcine uterine secretion , cyclic nucleotides , and catecholamines . this study investigated acute effects of 17 beta-estradiol ( e ) on ions , cyclic nucleotides , and catecholamines and their association with temporal changes in uterine secretory products in pregnant , cyclic , and nonpregnant gilts . uterine flushings ( utf ) and endometrium ( endom ) from one uterine horn of nonpregnant and pregnant gilts ( n = 9 ) were collected on days 10 , 12 , and 14 ( n = 3 ) . protein , plasma inhibitor ( p less than 0.05 ) , na+ , and k+ ( p less than 0.01 ) increased linearly in utf of pregnant gilts . ca2+ changed biphasically , with higher concentrations ( p less than 0.01 ) in pregnant gilts on day 12. endometrial camp and cgmp ( p less than 0.05 ) increased between days 12 and 14 of pregnancy . the utf norepinephrine ( ne ) concentrations increased ( p less than 0.01 ) in cyclic gilts between days 12 and 14 , while endometrial ne increased between days 10 and 12 and then decreased on day 14. the utf of pregnant gilts had higher ( p less than 0.05 ) concentrations of dopamine ( da ) , which peaked on day 12 and then decreased ( p less than 0.01 ) by day 14. da in utf of nonpregnant gilts decreased between days 10 and 12 and remained low on day 14. a catecholamine metabolite , 3 , 4-dihydroxyphenylglycol , in endom ( p less than 0.05 ) and utf ( p less than 0.01 ) decreased linearly between days 10 and 14. the turnover rate of endometrial catecholamines was 2.4-fold higher ( p less than 0.05 ) during early pregnancy compared with that in cyclic gilts . effects of acute administration of exogenous e ( 0.5 mg ) were also studied . the utf and endom were from day 11 nonpregnant gilts 0 , 30 , 60 , and 360 min ( n = 3 ) post-e or post-saline-ethanol ( c ) injection ( n = 9 ) . potassium , plasma inhibitor ( p less than 0.01 ) , and cgmp ( p less than 0.05 ) increased rapidly ( 30 min ) after e injection . the k+ level changed biphasically , with increased concentrations again at 360 min . plasmin inhibitor returned to levels similar to controls by 60 min , whereas cgmp remained elevated until 360 min postinjection when e , ca2+ , k+ ( p less than 0.01 ) , and na+ ( p less than 0.03 ) were increased . endom ne ( p less than 0.05 ) and utf da ( p less than 0.05 ) were lower in e-treated gilts . additionally , the turnover rate was significantly lower ( p less than 0.05 ) for ne and da in the utf of e-treated gilts . an increase in ca2+ in utf preceded increases in protein secretions ( except plasmin inhibitor ) and may play a role in e-stimulated endometrial epithelial secretory vesicle exocytosis .

regulation of prolactin production and cell growth by estradiol : difference in sensitivity to estradiol occurs at level of messenger ribonucleic acid accumulation . 17 beta-estradiol increases the growth rate of gh4c1 cells with a half-maximally effective concentration ( ec50 ) that is about 10-fold less than the ec50 for the stimulation of prl production . we have examined the effects of five other estrogens : estriol , estrone , 17 alpha-estradiol , and the metabolism-resistant analogs ethynyl estradiol and moxestrol . all were full agonists for both effects , and all were more potent for the stimulation of cell growth than for stimulation of prl production . the order of analog potency for both biological effects was the same as the order of potency for inhibiting saturable [ 3h ] estradiol binding to intact cells . therefore , both biological effects appear to be mediated through the same receptor , and metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol is unlikely to account for the difference in the concentrations required to elicit the two effects . we selected two estrogen-responsive clones from a cdna library made from gh4c1 cells . the clones were chosen because they were induced at the estrogen concentrations that stimulate growth . estradiol caused maximal stimulation of the mrnas corresponding to the two recombinant clones at 10 ( -10 ) m , a concentration over 10-fold lower than that required for maximal stimulation of prl mrna . these data indicate that a difference in sensitivity to estrogen occurs at the level of mrna accumulation as well as at the level of the biological responses . 
bipolar secretion of androgen-binding protein and transferrin by sertoli cells cultured in a two-compartment culture chamber . the influence of various medium supplements on sertoli cell ( sc ) monolayer permeability to [ 3h ] inulin and polarized secretion of transferrin ( trf ) and androgen-binding protein ( abp ) was investigated in a two-compartment culture chamber . sc from 14- and 18-day-old rats were maintained for 13 days in one of the following media : modified eagle 's medium-ham 's f-12 ( dfm ) , dfm plus insulin , epidermal growth factor , progesterone , hydrocortisone , and vitamins a and e ( 6f ) , 6f plus testosterone ( 7f ) , 7f plus fsh ( 8f ) , 6f plus 2 % fetal bovine serum ( 6f2s ) , 6f plus 5 % fetal bovine serum ( 6f5s ) . the monolayer permeability to [ 3h ] inulin decreased rapidly during the initial 3-5 days of culture for the sc isolated from 18- and 14-day old animals , then remained stable in all media except dfm . morphological examination revealed the presence of tight junctions between neighbouring sc in both age groups , indicating their de novo formation . secretion of trf was lowest in dfm and steadily declined . in all other media , trf secretion peaked on day 5 and remained relatively constant after day 7. medium 7f only slightly and inconsistently increased the secretion , whereas 8f was always highly stimulatory compared to 6f . supplementation of 6f with serum resulted in the greatest trf secretion . in the case of abp , three different secretion patterns were noted depending on the medium composition ; secretion was greatest in the presence of 5 % fetal bovine serum . the medium supplements also differentially affected the polarity of trf and abp secretion . the ratio of trf secreted to the outer and inner compartments ( oc / ic ) was approximately 2.0 in dfm and was not influenced by supplements in 6f , 7f , and 8f . however , in serum-containing media , the oc / ic ratio gradually increased with time to about 5.0 on day 13. the average oc / ic ratio of abp was 1.7 in dfm and , in contrast to trf , declined to 0.7 in other serum-free media . serum supplementation reversed and increased the abp ratio to about 6.0 on day 13. these data indicate that sc grown on permeable supports form confluent monolayers that limit the diffusion of macromolecules , most likely due to the formation of tight junctions . the monolayer permeability as well as the total and polarized secretion of trf and abp are differentially regulated by hormones and serum factors . 
acute decrease in progesterone and increase in estrogen secretion caused by relaxin during late pregnancy in beef heifers . purified porcine relaxin ( 3000 u / mg ) was administered im ( rlx-im ; 1 mg ; n = 2 ) and in the cervical os ( rlx-os ; 1 mg ; n = 2 ) on day 273 ( approximately 10 days before parturition normally occurs ) of gestation to determine the profiles of immunoreactive relaxin and its effects on progesterone , estrone ( e1 ) , and 17 beta-estradiol ( 17 beta-e2 ) secretion in peripheral blood plasma of beef heifers . controls received either 0.01 m pbs ( 1 ml , im ; n = 2 ) or 0.01 m gel-pbs ( gel ; 1 ml , os ; n = 2 ) in cervical os . one relaxin-treated ( im ) heifer calved at 4 h and 36 min after treatment ; thus , data from this heifer were not included in subsequent analysis . relaxin-treated heifers showed an acute elevation in relaxin , a precipitous decrease in progesterone , and a significant ( p less than 0.05 ) elevation of e1 and 17 beta-e2 . plasma relaxin levels were 4.95 , 1.5 , and 0.24 ng / ml at 0.5 h in rlx-im , rlx-os , and control animals , respectively . peripheral plasma relaxin peaked between 23-31 ng / ml 1-2.5 h before returning to less than 0.5 ng / ml 5-12 h after treatment . relaxin administration accounted for 70 % , 73 % , and 58 % of the progesterone , e1 , and 17 beta-e2 variability between treatments , respectively . an abrupt decrease ( p less than 0.01 ) in progesterone preceded the rises ( p less than 0.05 ) in e1 and 17 beta-e2 at 1.5 , 2-2.5 , and 2-3.5 h , respectively . maximum progesterone deviations from the pretreatment mean concentration were -5.43 , -3.05 , and -0.92 ng / ml for rlx-im , rlx-os , and controls . progesterone rebounded from 36 % to 61 % and 62 % to 79 % of respective pretreatment means for rlx-im and rlx-os . peak elevation of e1 was 407.3 , 306.5 , and 71.5 pg / ml and that of 17 beta-e2 was 82.2 , 35.8 , and 7.8 ng / ml for rlx-im , rlx-os , and controls , respectively . these results provide strong evidence that a pharmacological dosage of relaxin induces an acute depression of progesterone secretion beginning within 90 min in beef heifers during late pregnancy . we suggest that these early and marked luteolytic effects of relaxin on progesterone secretion in cattle could be by direct or indirect actions via mechanisms that are yet unknown . 
triiodothyronine binding in adult rat brain : compartmentation of receptor populations in purified neuronal and glial nuclei . in order to investigate the localization of nuclear t3 receptors in adult rat brain , we have developed a technique for separating neuronal and glial nuclei , and compared nuclear t3 binding in both fractions . glial and neuronal nuclear populations were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain except the cerebellum , followed by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in 2.4 and 2.2 m sucrose . for purposes of comparison , liver nuclei were prepared by centrifugation in 2.4 m sucrose . microscopic examination of the nuclei confirmed the purity of the two nuclear fractions to be above 90 % with minimal extranuclear contamination . t3 binding studies were performed on the washed nuclear fractions using saturation analysis techniques . maximum binding ( bmax ) and dissociation constant ( kd ) were obtained by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis . after 30 min incubation at 37 c , bmax in neuronal nuclei was 1203 + / - 118 fmol / mg dna ( mean + / - se ) ( n = 6 ) , in comparison with 196 + / - 14 fmol / mg dna in glial nuclei ( n = 7 ) . the corrected value for bmax in glial nuclei , assuming 8 % neuronal nuclear contamination , was 100 fmol / mg dna . bmax in liver nuclei was contamination , was 100 fmol / mg dna . bmax in liver nuclei was 299 + / - 38 fmol / mg dna ( n = 6 ) . the kd values were 0.38 + / - 0.04 nm , 0.34 + / - 0.05 nm , and 0.33 + / - 0.04 nm in neuronal , glial , and liver nuclei , respectively . the specificity of t3 binding to the nuclear receptor in both neuronal and glial nuclei was studied in competition studies , and revealed closely similar relative binding affinities ( t3 greater than t4 greater than rt3 ) in both . we conclude that the higher t3 binding capacity of neuronal nuclei may be related to their higher protein synthetic ability , suggesting that t3 may be of importance in a rapid structural turnover in these cells . the effect of t3 on myelination in glial cells may be mediated through the nucleus . 
dynamic pituitary and ovarian changes occurring during the anestrus to estrus transition in the golden hamster . anestrous hamsters exhibit daily afternoon gonadotropin and progesterone surges , but little estrogen secretion . in the first experiment , short day anestrous females were transferred to long days to detect hormonal changes associated with recovery of cyclicity . morning and afternoon blood samples were taken at increasing durations in long days . females autopsied at their first vaginal estrus after transfer to long days differed from long day estrous controls only in their lower uterine weights . some females at all durations exhibited signs of recovery , though they had not yet shown estrus . they did not display afternoon gonadotropin surges and had low circulating progesterone but high estradiol levels , stimulated uteri , and enhanced follicular development . results of the second and third experiments provided evidence that the daily gonadotropin surges are not the cause per se of anestrus , and that changes in estrogen secretion are essential for the transition to and from anestrus . phenobarbital blockade of the daily surges in anestrous females did not result in increased follicular growth and estrogen secretion . furthermore , daily afternoon injections of gonadotropins it appears that the daily surges in anestrous hamsters simply reflect low estradiol levels . it is still not known what signal promotes rapid follicular maturation during the recovery from anestrus . once initiated , however , this recovery appears to occur within a few days , with a rapid cascade of events . first , follicular development and estrogen secretion resume , and the daily lh surges cease . then , progesterone levels decline , and an ovulatory surge of gonadotropins is triggered . 
the carbohydrate moiety of bovine thyrotropin is essential for full bioactivity but not for receptor recognition . tsh is a glycoprotein hormone whose carbohydrate content varies among different species . although recent studies suggest that variants of tsh deficient in carbohydrate occur naturally , the significance of the carbohydrate moiety of tsh in respect to its thyrotropic function is unclear . the present studies were undertaken , therefore , to examine this question . a highly purified preparation of bovine tsh ( btsh ) was deglycosylated by treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride . amino acid and carbohydrate analyses of the original and deglycosylated preparations indicated that approximately 85 % of the carbohydrate originally present had been removed and that the protein moiety was unaltered . as judged from tsh radioreceptor assays , btsh and deglycosylated btsh ( dg-btsh ) bound to human thyroid membranes with equal affinity , since both caused a half-maximal inhibition of [ 125i ] btsh binding at approximately equal concentrations . nonetheless , dg-btsh at optimal concentration displayed only about one third the activity of intact tsh in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity in human thyroid membranes . dg-btsh also antagonized the adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity of intact btsh in this system , but only weakly , since abolition of the btsh effect required an approximately 40-fold higher concentration of dg-btsh . in cultures of frtl5 cells , a cloned line of follicular cells derived from normal rat thyroid , both intact and dg-btsh enhanced cell growth , as measured by [ 3h ] thymidine incorporation and stimulated camp release in the medium , but the response elicited by dg-btsh was much less than that caused by equal concentrations of the intact hormone . in accord with the findings in the in vitro assays , dg-btsh evoked a much smaller response than btsh did in the in vivo mouse assay . it is concluded that although not required for receptor recognition , the carbohydrate moiety of btsh is essential for the full expression of its biological activity . 
osmotic pressure regulation of prolactin and growth hormone release from bovine secretory granules . prl and gh are stored in bovine pituitary secretory granules in part as intermolecular disulfide-linked multimers ( as many as 50 monomers / oligomer ) . in vitro incubation of granules with reduced glutathione ( gsh ) results in the production of monomeric hormones and increased hormone release . we tested the hypothesis that increases in intragranular osmolality due to conversion of oligomers to lower mol wt forms are key to granule rupture . hormone release was measured after granule incubations in medium made hyperosmotic by the addition of raffinose or sucrose . prl release at ph 7.8 with 0.7 m raffinose was reduced to 43.5 % of the control value , whereas gh release ranged from 70-100 % of the control value . augmented release stimulated by 2 mm gsh was also diminished by raffinose , to 17.9 % ( prl ) and 75.6 % ( gh ) of control values . the ic50 for raffinose inhibition of prl release was 0.62 m ; this shifted to 0.38 m in the presence of 2 mm gsh . raffinose also blunted the granule response to gsh at all other gsh concentrations tested and decreased stimulated release at ph 9 as well as at 7.8 . interference with the ability to maintain an osmotic gradient , a maneuver accomplished by partial disruption of granule membranes with 0.5 % deoxycholate treatment , reduced or abolished the raffinose inhibition . molecular sizing of granule fractions on superose-6 ( pharmacia ) indicated that prl monomers remaining in the pelletable granule fraction increased with raffinose about 2-fold under both basal and gsh-stimulated conditions . these data support the concept that thiol : disulfide equilibria may be important in prl and gh storage and secretion by their influence on intragranular osmolality . in exocytosis in vivo , osmotically mediated granule rupture may be triggered by thiols during granule : plasma membrane fusion . 
the metabolism of vitamin d3 during fracture healing in chicks . the metabolism of vitamin d3 was studied in chicks after experimental fractures were performed on their tibiae . the chicks were fed for 3 weeks a vitamin d-deficient diet but were supplemented with radioactive labeled vitamin d3 . the chicks were then divided into two groups . in the first group the right tibia was fractured , whereas the second group served as nonfractured control group . during the following days of fracture healing , the metabolites of [ 3h ] vitamin d3 were measured in callus , epiphysis , diaphysis , plasma , duodenum , and kidney . histological examination of calluses and bones , measurements of intestinal absorption of calcium , and renal production of dihydroxylated metabolites of vitamin d3 were performed as well . the levels of the dihydroxylated metabolites were increased in the calluses and the levels of [ 3h ] 24 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 were found to coincide with the formation of cartilaginous tissue and with the renal production of this steroid . in the duodenum of the fractured chicks , the levels of [ 3h ] 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 dropped significantly during the first week after fracture , coinciding with reduction in the intestinal absorption of calcium . in the plasma during those 3 weeks of healing process the levels of [ 3h ] 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 were far below normal . these findings indicate that during the process of fracture repair , changes in the metabolism and expression of vitamin d are taking place in order to meet the new requirements of the body under stress condition of skeletal fracture . 
1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 exerts opposite effects on the regulation of human embryonic and nonembryonic alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes . the regulation of alkaline phosphatase activity by steroid hormones was studied in two human breast cancer cell lines , mda-mb-157 and bt20 . mda-mb-157 cells were shown to express the alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme produced by normal breast tissue , and the activity of this isoenzyme increased 3-fold after a 72-h treatment of these cells with 10 ( -7 ) m 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 [ 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 ] , 2-fold after treatment with 10 ( -6 ) m hydrocortisone ( hc ) , and 5-fold after treatment with both hormones . bt20 cells did not express the isoenzyme phenotypic to breast , but ectopically expressed the isoenzyme phenotypic to term placenta and other embryonic tissue . treatment of bt20 cells with 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 results in a 30 % decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity of the embryonic isoenzyme . there was a 2-fold increase in activity after treatment with hc , and enzyme activity was similar to control values after treatment with both hormones . for both cell lines , changes in alkaline phosphatase activity correlated with changes in nanograms of isoenzyme per mg cellular protein , as measured by ria . increases in enzyme activity were inhibited when the cells were incubated simultaneously with the steroids and cycloheximide . studies with receptors in each cell line showed that both cell lines bound 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 and that a 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3-binding protein with the same mol wt as the d3 receptor was present in both . the bt20 cells also express a larger mol wt protein which binds 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 but is not as specific for the 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 isomer . hc receptors were similar in quantity and binding affinity in both cell lines . 
effect of thyroid hormones and high carbohydrate feeding on gene expression in rat epididymal adipose tissue . we have determined the messenger rna activity profiles of epididymal fat in euthyroid , hypothyroid , and hyperthyroid rats as well as in animals fed a high carbohydrate fat-free ( lipogenic ) diet . radioautographs of two-dimensional gels of the in vitro translational products of rna were quantitated by computer-assisted videodensitometry and analyzed by multivariate statistics . of the 250 spots observed , each presumably representing the translational product of a separate messenger rna , 21 were responsive to changes in hormonal state . eighteen increased and two decreased at some stage in the transition from the hypothyroid to the hyperthyroid state . one spot changed in a biphasic manner . eight products responded to the lipogenic diet , six increasing and two decreasing . six of these eight spots responded in a similar fashion to thyroid hormone administration . as previously shown for liver , there appears to be a substantial overlap between the genomic response to carbohydrate and thyroid hormone administration . whereas the carbohydrate-generated changes are largely included in the thyroid-hormone induced alterations , the majority of thyroid hormone responsive changes are not duplicated by the diet . multivariate analysis showed a clear separation of each state from the others and revealed that it was necessary to monitor only nine spots to achieve an effective separation of the states analyzed . 
nuclear 3 , 5 , 3'-triiodothyronine ( t3 ) in brown adipose tissue : receptor occupancy and sources of t3 as determined by in vivo techniques . the amount and sources of t3 associated with high affinity , low capacity cellular nuclear receptors in brown adipose tissue ( bat ) have been estimated by in vivo pulse-labeling techniques . maximal binding capacity was measured by in vivo saturation analysis . nuclear receptor occupancy at endogenous levels of t3 and t4 in euthyroid rats was estimated from the equilibrium nuclear to serum ratio of tracer t3 , and the locally generated nuclear t3 to serum t4 ratio after injecting tracer t3 and t4 . these ratios were multiplied , respectively , by the endogenous concentrations of t3 and t4 as measured by ria . the maximal binding capacity was 0.65 ng t3 / mg dna , and saturation was 71 % . fifty-five percent of the nuclear t3 was generated locally , and 45 % was derived from circulating t3 . bat is , hence , comparable to the liver in number of receptors ( approximately 5000 / cell ) and to the pituitary with regard to saturation and relative contributions of locally generated t3 and plasma t3 to nuclear t3 . these results suggest that bat may be an important target for thyroid hormones and , along with other data , that alterations in the activity of the type ii 5'-deiodinase of this tissue may influence the saturation of nuclear t3 receptors . 
oxytocin gene expression in discrete hypothalamic magnocellular cell groups is stimulated by prolonged salt loading . the effect of prolonged osmotic stimulation on the oxytocin ( ot ) mrna levels of ot-producing neurons was investigated in separate hypothalamic nuclei of the rat . after drinking 2 % nacl for 2 weeks , a 2-fold increase in the ot mrna content was found by northern blot analysis of microdissected supraoptic nucleus ( son ) and paraventricular nucleus ( pvn ) . the same samples showed a similar change in vasopressin ( vp ) mrna levels . this treatment resulted in a 70 % depletion of both ot and vp from the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland and a marked increase in ot and vp plasma levels . analysis of the ot mrna concentration by quantitative in situ hybridization showed that the son , pvn , and anterior commissural nucleus responded similarly , with a 1.5-fold increase in ot mrna after 7 days of osmotic stimulation . these results demonstrate that ot gene expression in the magnocellular neurons of the son , pvn , and anterior commissural nucleus is sensitive to this osmotic stimulus , as is the vp gene of magnocellular neurons in the son and pvn . the responsiveness of ot-producing neurons may point to a role for ot in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance . 
progressive recruitment of follicular cells with graded secretory responsiveness during stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyrotropin . one of the earliest responses of the thyroid cells to tsh is macropinocytosis with formation of intracellular colloid droplets . we demonstrate here that increasing stimulation with tsh not only elicits a highly individual macropinocytotic response among different follicular cells but that the fraction of tsh-responsive cells is also a function of the tsh dose . after pretreatment with t4 , mice and rats were injected ip with bovine tsh and killed 2 h later . the macropinocytotic response to tsh was evaluated on periodic acid-schiff-stained 3-microns sections of the thyroids in terms of droplet number per 25 follicles and , in addition , by assessing recruitment , i.e. percentage of droplet-containing cells . both variables increased with increasing tsh stimulation until they reached a plateau at about 9 mu tsh in mice and at about 300 mu tsh in rats : the percentage of droplet-containing cells gradually increased in mice from 2 % ( no tsh ) to 67 % ( 9 mu tsh ) and in rats from 11 % ( no tsh ) to 54 % ( 300 mu tsh ) . overall pinocytotic response as well as thyrocyte recruitment could be modified by extra- and intrathyroidal factors : for example , pretreatment of the mice with an iodine-deficient diet increased the maximal percentage of droplet containing cells to nearly 90 % . obviously , two separate components of the macropinocytotic response of the thyroid gland to tsh can be distinguished : the first is the gradually increasing fraction of droplet-containing cells , the second is the well known increase of the number of colloid droplets in each tsh-responsive cell with progressive tsh stimulation . recruitment of thyrocytes with a gradually increasing natural threshold to a hormonal stimulus appears to be a fundamental mechanism in the thyroid gland and possibly in other organs . 
indices of noradrenergic function in the central nervous system of seizure-naive genetically epilepsy-prone rats . norepinephrine concentrations and tyrosine hydroxylase activity were determined in the brains of moderate-seizure and severe-seizure genetically epilepsy-prone rats ( geprs ) and in nonepileptic control rats . both moderate-seizure ( gepr-3 ) and severe-seizure ( gepr-9 ) animals had widespread abnormalities in brain norepinephrine concentrations . abnormalities in tyrosine hydroxylase activity were restricted to the midbrain . the state of abnormal seizure susceptibility , but not severity , in the gepr may be determined by noradrenergic deficits in the hypothalamus / thalamus . both seizure severity and susceptibility may be determined by noradrenergic deficits in the telencephalon , midbrain , and pons-medulla . seizure severity but not susceptibility may be determined by noradrenergic abnormalities in the cerebellum . 
congenital defects among the offspring of epileptic fathers : role of the genotype and phenytoin therapy in a mouse model . the progeny of coisogenic c57bl / 6j mice homozygous for either the tottering ( tg / tg ) or wildtype ( + / + ) allele were examined to determine the role of parental seizure disorders and paternal anticonvulsant drug therapy on the incidence of congenital malformations . pregnancy outcomes in which one , both , or neither of the parents had an epileptic genotype were compared for various maternal and fetal reproductive parameters . in addition , the progeny from phenytoin-treated male tottering ( tg / tg ) mice with a spontaneous seizure disorder and from control untreated ( + / + ) male mice were similarly examined for evidence of congenital defects . the results of these experiments suggest that neither the parental genotype with respect to seizure disorders nor paternal anticonvulsant treatment with phenytoin is responsible for an increased incidence of congenital malformations . 
seizures induced or aggravated by anticonvulsants . six cases of epileptic children are reported , in whom anticonvulsant therapy , aggravated rather than controlled the seizures or induced minor seizures . this was caused by excessive polytherapy in one case and by the use of the inappropriate drug ( for that type of epilepsy ) in four other cases . in the sixth case , the appropriate anticonvulsant was used , but it induced multiple astatic-myoclonic seizures . this phenomenon of drug-induced seizures is apt to occur particularly in certain types of childhood epilepsy that are refractory to therapy and are accompanied by slow spike-wave discharges in the eeg , such as the lennox-gastaut syndrome . 
effect of interictal epileptiform discharges on nocturnal plasma prolactin concentrations in epileptic patients with complex partial seizures . to investigate the effect of interictal epileptiform discharges ( ieds ) on plasma prolactin ( prl ) level , we studied 18 epileptic patients with complex partial seizures ( cps ) who did not experience clinical or subclinical ictal events during all-night monitoring with polygraphic recording and video imaging . the density of ieds peaked during non-rem stages and was significantly reduced during rem stage . mean plasma prl concentrations in epileptic patients , when sampled at 30-min intervals , showed a moderate but significant elevation during non-rem ( p less than 0.001 ) and awake stages ( p less than 0.005 ) , but not during rem stage , when compared with 10 nonepileptic control subjects studied in a similar fashion . the data obtained in this physiologically controlled environment indicate that the cumulative effect of ieds may modify prl regulatory mechanisms , resulting in a modest elevation of plasma concentrations independent of ictal discharges . 
prevalence and prognosis of epilepsy in patients with multiple sclerosis . an analysis of 599 clinically definite multiple sclerosis ( ms ) patients including all known cases of the southern province of finland in january 1 , 1979 revealed epileptic seizures in 21 ( 3.5 % ) patients . on that date , 12 patients needed treatment ( 2.0 % ) . the age-adjusted prevalence of active epilepsy was significantly higher than that in the general population . the percentage of partial seizures ( 67 % ) was significantly increased in proportion to a series of 100 adult epilepsy patients , with a comparable age distribution . in 10 patients ( including three patients with symptomatic epilepsy ) , the attacks appeared before the ms symptoms . the mean follow-up after the first seizures was 19.3 years . in 10 patients , the seizures disappeared totally during the surveillance until september 1985. our results show an increased comorbidity between ms and epilepsy . in most cases , however , the prognosis of epilepsy was good and there seemed not to be any clear correlation between the severity of ms and epilepsy . 
epilepsy in general practice : the dutch situation . treatment and supervision of epileptic patients is part of specialist medicine . a possible change in the role of specialists and general practitioners in the care of these patients was explored by a questionnaire mailed to all dutch neurologists and a random sample of general practitioners . patients were also asked their opinion . the real situation was studied in a group of patients retrieved from the registers of general practitioners . demographic , psychosocial , and epilepsy characteristics were sampled . specialists tend not to want a change in their role ; general practitioners desire a change . at present , patients do not want a change , but in future a change might be acceptable to them . more patients than expected were supervised by their general practitioner only . their demographic and psychosocial characteristics did not differ from those in the population at large . epilepsy characteristics corresponded with those in other studies . 
previous experiences with epilepsy and effectiveness of information to change public perception of epilepsy . differences with regard to the effectiveness of health information and attitude change are suggested between people with direct , behavioral experiences with a health topic and people with indirect , nonbehavioral experiences . the effects of three different methods of health education about epilepsy , frequently used in health education practice , are assessed in a pretest posttest design with control groups , controlling for experiences with epilepsy . subjects were 132 students from teacher-training colleges . after all treatments , attitudes , and knowledge about epilepsy were changed in a positive way . treatments were found to be equally effective . before treatment , direct behavioral experiences were related to knowledge and a more positive attitude towards epilepsy . after treatment , subjects with direct behavioral experiences with epilepsy showed less change of attitude and knowledge as compared with subjects with indirect experiences . direct experiences appear to restrain the processing of new information and attitude change . 
fertility in persons with epilepsy : 1935-1974 . data from the rochester-olmsted county medical records linkage project were utilized to assess fertility in persons with epilepsy . population age-specific reproduction rates for rochester residents for the years 1935-1974 were estimated using the number of live births from the minnesota department of health statistics and vital statistics of the u.s. for comparison with rates in affected persons . overall , fertility rates were significantly reduced to 80 % of expected for affected males and 85 % for affected females . individuals with partial seizures ( simple and complex ) were disadvantaged , whereas those with generalized onset were not . during the last 20 years of the study period , males were more disadvantaged than females . the male-female difference was greatest during the time of low population fertility ( after 1965 ) . male deficits were more marked after diagnosis ; female deficits were more marked before diagnosis . differences in the proportion of ever-married person-years between the sexes only partially explain the observed differences . 
academic achievement of children with epilepsy . the academic achievement scores of 122 children with epilepsy were examined in relation to demographic and clinical seizure variables . as a group , these children were making less academic progress than expected for their age and iq level . academic deficiencies were greatest in arithmetic , followed by spelling , reading , comprehension , and word recognition . results of the multiple regression analyses indicated a modest combined predictive significance of the demographic and clinical seizure variables for academic performance . in addition , the magnitude of these relationships varied by academic area . among the individual variables examined the strongest correlates of academic performance were age of the child , age of seizure onset , lifetime total seizure frequency , and presence of multiple seizures ( absence and tonic-clonic ) . these results are discussed in relation to developing an understanding of the factors which underlie academic vulnerability in children with epilepsy . 
behavioral characteristics of epilepsy patients compared with normal controls . using neuropsychological testing procedures , we measured the behavioral characteristics of patients with epilepsy unaffected by anticonvulsant drugs and compared these results with control subjects matched for age , sex , and education . in a nationwide va cooperative study , 622 patients with well-defined seizure types were given a selected battery of neuropsychological tests prior to and at 1 month after initiation of drug therapy . seventy-four control subjects were administered the same test battery under standardized conditions at the same va testing centers . all tests of controls were also repeated 1 month later . the patients with epilepsy scored significantly and consistently below the level of the control subjects on all but three behavioral measures . differences reaching statistical significance were found on tests of motor function ( finger tapping , pegboard , color naming ) , cognitive-attention ( digit symbol , discriminative reaction time , word fluency ) , and subtests of the profile of mood status ( tension , depression , vigor , and confusion ) . these data provide a profile of behavioral characteristics of unmedicated patients with epilepsy . 
ictal tinnitus . unilateral high pitched tinnitus was the sole epileptic ictal manifestation of a 45-year-old woman . electrographic seizures originated from the contralateral midtemporal area and consistently correlated with tinnitus . computed tomography ( ct ) demonstrated a lesion involving the superior temporal gyrus and inferior portion of the supramarginal gyrus . the case illustrates a cortical origin of tinnitus . 
nonsurgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy . 
endometrial tissue in peritoneal fluid . peritoneal fluid ( pf ) was studied for the presence of endometrial tissue in a consecutive series of 67 women ( with documented tubal patency ) undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy , tubal lavage , and hysteroscopy . pf was completely aspirated from the cul-de-sac both before and after uterine irrigation . the pf was then analyzed for the presence of endometrial tissue . in native pf no significant difference in the incidence of endometrial tissue between patients with ( 19 % ) and without ( 11 % ) endometriosis ( p = 0.6 ) was observed . refluxed pf , obtained after uterine irrigation , showed a significantly higher incidence of endometrial tissue in women with endometriosis ( 76 % ) as compared to controls ( 42 % ) ( p = 0.03 ) . we propose two models to explain the development of endometriosis . these are not mutually exclusive , may be independent of each other , and may represent two distinct pathophysiologic disease processes . 
classification of endometriotic implants by morphologic appearance and capacity to synthesize prostaglandin f . the severity of the symptoms of endometriosis has not always correlated well with the anatomic severity of the disease . this lack of correlation may be due to variations in the metabolic activity of the endometriotic implants present at different stages of the disease . because prostaglandin f ( pgf ) has been implicated as a hormonal mediator of the clinical symptoms of endometriosis , pgf synthesis and content was measured in implants from 14 patients with mild , moderate , severe , or extensive disease . to assess whether pgf production was related to the status of implants , the authors classified implants , based on gross and histologic criteria , as petechial or reddish ; intermediate or brown ; or powder-burn or black . pgf production of implants from patients with mild or moderate disease was greater than that of implants from patients with severe or extensive disease ( p less than 0.05 ) , and pgf content was similar for all stages of endometriosis . petechial implants produced twice the amount of pgf than intermediate implants ( p less than 0.05 ) , which in turn produced more pgf than powder-burn implants ( p less than 0.05 ) . powder-burn implants did not have the in vitro capacity to produce pgf , and the amount of pgf contained in implants of all classes was similar . therefore , endometriotic implant pgf production and possibly other biochemical activities are dependent on the physical status of the implant . the classification of implants by morphologic appearance may afford additional assistance in determining the prognosis of the disease and in the examination of the subtle effects of the disease on symptoms . 
a preoperative classification to predict the intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy rates after distal tubal microsurgery . a simple preoperative classification is described to predict the intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy rates following distal tubal microsurgery . laser co2 microsurgical salpingostomies were performed on 76 patients between january 1979 and january 1984. all of the patients underwent a preoperative assessment , which included hysterosalpingogram and laparoscopy , to formulate a preoperative classification based on a point system . the patients were divided into four groups according to tubal damage , with a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rate of 58.3 % in grade i , 36.6 % in grade ii , 9.5 % in grade iii , and 0 % in grade iv . the patients were divided into four groups according to adhesions , with a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rate of 38.8 % with no adhesion , 32.0 % with mild adhesions , 26.6 % with moderate adhesions , and 5.5 % with severe adhesions . from these results , a preoperative management is proposed for patients being considered for either distal tubal microsurgery or in vitro fertilization . 
subtle abnormalities in follicular development and hormonal profile in women with unexplained infertility . a prospective study of six unselected couples diagnosed as having unexplained infertility was done . in three of six patients , subtle abnormalities in follicular development were detected . in the first case poor follicular growth was observed . there was a premature small rise of luteinizing hormone ( lh ) with subsequent low levels of estradiol ( e2 ) in the late follicular phase and unusual wide lh peak . this was followed by low progesterone levels in the luteal phase . in the second case follicular growth was abrupted by premature lh surge . this surge was triggered by early rise of e2 level while the follicle was still small in size . in the third case luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome was diagnosed , on ultrasound examination . all of the abnormalities were repetitive . 
oral contraceptives in diabetic women : metabolic effects of four compounds with different estrogen / progestogen profiles . the metabolic effects of four oral contraceptives with different estrogen / progestogen profiles ( monophasic nonalkylated estrogen / norethindrone , low-dose monophasic ethinyl estradiol ( ee2 ) / norethindrone , progestogen only treatment with norethindrone , and triphasic ee2 / levonorgestrel ) were examined in insulin-dependent diabetic women . during the 6-month study period , no differences were found in fasting plasma glucose , 24-hour insulin requirements , glycated hemoglobin , free fatty acids , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations , or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol / total cholesterol ratio between the patients in each treatment group . compared with the nonalkylated estrogen / norethindrone and the triphasic ee2 / levonorgestrel formulations , the low-dose ee2 / norethindrone combination resulted in small but significant increases in plasma triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( p less than 0.01 ) , which seemed unfavorable from a clinical point of view . norethindrone-only treatment appeared to be an appropriate alternative to both the nonalkylated estrogen / norethindrone combination and the triphasic ee2 / levonorgestrel formulations . 
intracervical versus intrauterine insemination : correlation of outcome with antecedent postcoital testing . thirty-four infertile women alternated cycles of intracervical insemination ( ici ) with whole ejaculate homologous semen ( mean , 3.2 cycles / patient ) versus intrauterine insemination ( iui ) with washed sperm ( mean , 3.4 cycles / patient ) . twenty of the 34 women had prior postcoital tests consistently demonstrating less than or equal to 3 motile sperm per high-powered field ( hpf ) . six of those 20 conceived during iui cycles ( 30.0 % ) ; 0 conceived during ici cycles ( p = 0.06 , mantel-haenszel chi-square test ) . the pregnancy rate per iui cycle was 6 / 72 ( 8.3 % ) , compared with 0 / 66 ( 0.0 % ) per ici cycle , a statistically significant difference ( p = 0.04 , fisher 's exact chi-square test ) . fourteen of 34 women had prior postcoital tests consistently demonstrating greater than or equal to 5 motile sperm per hpf . one of the 14 conceived during an iui cycle ( 7.1 % ) , and 2 conceived during ici cycles ( 14.3 % ) , a difference that was not significant . the pregnancy rate per iui cycle was 1 / 42 ( 2.4 % ) , compared with 2 / 42 ( 4.8 % ) per ici cycle ( not significant ) . iui may be helpful in the management of infertility associated with relatively poor postcoital tests ( less than or equal to 3 motile sperm per hpf ) but not with relatively good postcoital tests ( greater than or equal to 5 motile sperm per hpf ) . 
a study of women requesting interval contraceptive sterilization who do and do not return for surgery . with the use of initial records of 1128 women who presented for interval tubal ligation , characteristics of those who were sterilized were juxtaposed with characteristics of those who did not return for surgery . follow-up telephone interviews were conducted to explore regret after sterilization among 268 sterilized women . the subsequent histories of 144 women who did not return for surgery were examined , to determine whether failure to return might have screened , selectively , the women at greatest risk of regret . high levels of subsequent unwanted conception and pregnancy wastage were found in the nonreturn group . institutional factors were often implicated in failure to return . variables available at initial presentation are proposed to identify women who risk adverse consequences of postponed sterilization , to facilitate return without increasing regret . 
undetected ovulation in in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer patients . a retrospective evaluation was done of 102 consecutive in in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer ( ivf-et ) treatment cycles that culminated in surgical intervention for oocyte pickup . in 35 % of these patients , a disparity was noted in the number of mature follicles present on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration , compared with the day of surgery . this suggests the occurrence of undetected ovulation . an endogenous luteinizing hormone ( lh ) surge was detected in 14 of these patients . another cohort showed evidence of early luteinization without a detected endogenous lh surge . finally , a group without early luteinization was defined . possible explanations for these outcomes and the implications for success of ivf-et are discussed . 
does cyclic human chorionic gonadotropin secretion indicate embryo loss in in vitro fertilization ? the human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) beta subunit curve of normal singleton in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) pregnancies shows cyclic peaks during the first 56 days after embryo transfer ( et ) . this phenomenon is not demonstrable in normal spontaneous conceptions . the hcg curves of 151 singleton ivf pregnancies achieved by transfer of two , three , and four embryos therefore were compared statistically with the hcg curves of singleton ivf pregnancies achieved by transfer of only one embryo . the hcg levels of singleton ivf pregnancies achieved by transfer of more than one embryo had statistically higher hcg levels at 7 and 8 , 19 and 20 , and 37 and 38 days after et . in a separate evaluation it was observed that declines in hcg levels of normal singleton ivf pregnancies preceded four of five first-trimester abortion incidence peaks of singleton ivf pregnancies . the observed cyclic hcg secretion may be indicative of early embryo deaths . this observation supports the contention that multiple et results in significantly more multiple implantations than previously appreciated . thus embryo survival in utero may represent another major contributory factor to success or failure of ivf . 
the successful use of human amniotic fluid for mouse embryo culture and human in vitro fertilization , embryo culture , and transfer . the development of mouse and human embryos was assessed in human amniotic fluid to determine its suitability as a culture medium for human in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) . two-cell mouse embryos developed to blastocysts after 72 hours at rates similar to that in whittingham 's t6 + 10 % fetal calf serum . significantly more mouse embryos hatched in amniotic fluid . no difference was found between individual patient 's amniotic fluids obtained at 16 to 21 weeks ' gestation . a preliminary trial comparing amniotic fluid with t6 + maternal serum in human ivf showed no significant difference in fertilization rate and embryo development during 42 to 48 hours in vitro . expanded blastocysts were obtained in amniotic fluid after 5 days in vitro . four pregnancies were obtained in 9 patients ' transferred embryos grown in amniotic fluid and with 2 or 12 patients ' transferred embryos grown in t6 + maternal serum . 
factors influencing murine embryo bioassay : effects of proteins , aging of medium , and surgical glove coatings . the 2-cell murine embryo bioassay as quality control for human in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) was used to evaluate the effects of protein supplements , medium aging , and surgical glove coatings . ham 's f-10 medium ( gibco , grand island , ny ) without protein supplementation supported growth of the 2-cell embryos to blastocysts . addition of bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) , fetal cord serum ( fcs ) , or maternal serum ( ms ) did not enhance or reduce the blastulation rates ( medium alone , 89.4 % ; bsa , 86.4 % ; fcs , 90 % ; ms , 74.7 % ) . unsupplemented ham 's f-10 medium was found to contain three major peaks of approximately 50 , 000 daltons and several minor peaks , analyzed on high-performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) and sodium sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds-page ) , suggesting the presence of protein ( s ) in the medium itself . the storing of medium up to 425 days at 4 degrees c affected neither the hplc profile nor its ability to support embryo growth ( blastulation rates : fresh , 84 % ; stored 150 to 425 days , 77.7 % ) . the coating of surgical gloves affected embryo growth . both talc-coated ( tc ) and " talc-free , " starch-coated ( sc ) surgical gloves were found to be progressively embryotoxic when they touched the medium for increasing lengths of time , compared with uncoated latex ( ul ) gloves and untouched control medium . quality control of medium preparation and handling in murine embryo bioassay is reemphasized , with requirements for protein supplementation , use of fresh medium , and possible contamination with even talc-free , sc surgical gloves reevaluated . 
in vitro recovery of human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5'-monophosphate production in desensitized human granulosa-luteal cells . human granulosa-luteal cell production of cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5'-monophosphate ( camp ) and progesterone ( p ) were studied in response to purified human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) in cultured cells from hyperstimulated follicles of in vitro fertilized patients . the hcg injection given to the patients 36 hours before laparoscopy caused partial desensitization of adenylate cyclase of these cells to gonadotropins . preincubation of the cells in hormone free medium for 2 to 3 days significantly increased their camp responsiveness to hcg . p production was stimulated initially by hcg and showed no desensitization . in the cells preincubated for 72 hours without hcg , a subsequent stimulus of 50 ng / ml of hcg elicited maximal camp response , whereas 1 ng / ml of hcg was sufficient to bring about maximal p secretion . time-course studies indicated that maximal camp response to hcg was obtained in 1 to 3 hours . both basal and hcg-stimulated p accumulation continued to rise for up to 24 hours . preincubation of granulosa-luteal cells from hyperstimulated follicles improves the cells ' camp responsiveness to hcg , whereas p response remains unaltered . 
microsurgical epididymovasostomy in the treatment of occlusive azoospermia . in principle , azoospermia has two explanations : occlusion of the duct system and serious dysfunction of the testicular parenchyma . some cases of duct occlusion are suitable for reconstructive surgery . the authors describe a reconstructive technique based on full mobilization of a single loop of the epididymal duct as caudally as possible with two-layer side-to-end anastomosis to the vas deferens . to ensure follow-up evaluation of each anastomosis , unilateral anastomosis was done primarily . in a few cases , cross-over anastomosis was necessary . in cases of reoperation , if possible , this was performed on the same side . when the epididymal duct system was found empty , the contralateral epididymis was explored . patients with postoperative oligozoospermia were offered a supplementary contralateral operation . from 1980 to 1984 , 41 patients underwent epididymovasostomy . at follow-up evaluation , 35 ( 85 % ) presented sperms in repeated tests . fifteen of these patients ( 37 % ) have fathered children . patients with postoperative normospermia and no antisperm antibodies had an excellent fertility prognosis . the single-loop dissection technique provides anatomic specificity and a high percentage of patent anastomoses and does not interfere with the possibilities of reoperation . 
placental-type alkaline phosphatase in human seminal plasma from fertile and infertile men . solid-phase enzyme immunoassays , based on monoclonal antibodies reactive with different forms of human placental-type alkaline phosphatases , were applied to their detection in human seminal plasma from fertile and infertile men . the placental-like form of alkaline phosphatase ( plap-like ap ) , known to occur in testicular tissue , was found in normal seminal plasma . the incidence of detection and levels of this isoenzyme correlated significantly with the designated fertility status of the donor . seminal plasma ( plap-like ap ) may reflect germ cell function and / or access of testicular products to the ejaculate . 
enhancement of human sperm motility and velocity in vitro : effects of calcium and creatine phosphate . because of their roles in motility regulation and energy transport , calcium and creatine phosphate were examined for their effects on sperm motility and velocity in specimens of normal donors . semen or migrated sperm fractions were incubated with of 1 mmol of calcium , 5 mmol magnesium , and 10 mmol of creatine phosphate ( n = 28 ) or in the presence of 4 mumol of verapamil , calcium , and creatine phosphate ( n = 10 ) . the samples were subjected to multiple exposure photography ( four picture frames of two different drops ) at 0 , 1 , 4 , or 5 and at 10 hours and sperm motility and velocity were analyzed . in both calcium and calcium-creatine phosphate conditions , sperm motility and velocity were significantly increased , compared with control values ( p = between less than 0.001 and 0.05 ) . sperm motility declined following verapamil exposure , but the motility values remained at the level of the control in the presence of additional calcium or creatine phosphate . the effects of calcium and creatine phosphate take place rapidly ; within 1 minute all improvements in sperm velocity and motility are fully achieved . there is no loading effect of calcium , and when the sperm is transferred into media without the additional calcium , the velocity decreased to that of the initial control value . magnesium alone had no effect on motility or velocity . these experiments indicate that calcium or creatine phosphate can support sperm motility and velocity at a significantly increased level . thus the addition of calcium or creatine phosphate to the insemination media may enhance the fertilizing capacity of sperm during in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures . 
the effect of treatment on experimentally produced endometrial peritoneal implants . endometriosis was induced surgically by implanting pieces of endometrium in the uterine mesenteries of 50 rats . their fertility was then assessed after various treatments . ten rats with endometriosis were treated with microsurgical excision of implants , 10 with high-frequency diathermy , 10 with danazol , and 10 with intraperitoneal indomethacin . ten more rats had implants that were left untreated . the results were compared with those of ten rats that had sham surgery with implantation of fat in the uterine mesenteries . reproductive performance was better in control animals with sham surgery than in animals with endometrial implants . maximum restoration of fertility was achieved with indomethacin . microsurgery and danazol therapy both were effective in preventing residual endometriosis , but the animals tended to be less fertile after treatment . adhesions were most pronounced after diathermy and least pronounced after microsurgery or indomethacin therapy . in rats treated with indomethacin , persistent endometriotic cysts were invariably smaller near the site of intraperitoneal injection : this suggests a local antiprostaglandin effect . 
transmission of chlamydia trachomatis by artificial insemination . 
subfascial dextran 70 collection after intraperitoneal instillation of hyskon . our patient developed a subfascial collection of dextran 70 after intraabdominal instillation of hyskon . seroma and wound dehiscence should be ruled out . a nonleaking peritoneal closure may decrease the incidence of this complication . a nonleaking fascial closure will decrease the extension of the dextran 70 collection and prevent separation of the skin . 
transcervical balloon tuboplasty . tbt is a new technique that by use of a balloon catheter technique in a fashion similar to that of balloon angioplasty allows reestablishment of tubal patency in selected cases of tubal occlusion . the case presented here describes the first transcervical dilatation and recanalization of a proximally occluded fallopian tube in a patient with infertility . 
tubal causes of ectopic pregnancy . we did complete histologic study on 148 gravid tubes and found that nearly 90 % showed chronic lesions . cs was the most frequent lesion encountered ( 95.5 % ) , followed by sin ( 32.6 % ) . most frequently the lesions were extensive and both the ampulla and isthmus were involved . we therefore question the conservative approach in the treatment of certain tps .

diagnostic considerations in virilization : iodomethyl-norcholesterol scanning in the localization of androgen secreting tumors . accurate localization of the source of androgen hypersecretion is critical to the appropriate surgical or medical management of women with virilization . seven patients with virilization and hyperandrogenism of various causes were evaluated with the use of sequential studies : testosterone stimulation and suppression tests ; computerized tomography ( ct ) ; selective venous catheterization ; and 131i-iodomethyl-norcholesterol ( np-59 ) scintigraphy . comparison of the diagnostic accuracies of these localization studies with the ultimate diagnoses in this group of virilized women showed that : endocrinologic suppression / stimulation studies are of limited value in tumor localization and helpful only in patients with steroidogenic enzyme deficiencies ; both selective catheterization and ct scanning may provide spurious localization data ; and np-59 scintigraphy , by depicting both the anatomic localization and functional androgen hypersecretion , may provide the most significant localization data in the evaluation of patients with virilizing syndromes . 
bromocriptine therapy in normoprolactinemic women with unexplained infertility and galactorrhea . forty-three women with unexplained infertility and 16 women who ovulated with clomiphene citrate therapy , yet failed to conceive , were evaluated because of the presence of expressible galactorrhea and normal random prolactin levels . the overall mean duration of infertility for these women was 5.68 + / - 0.33 years ( mean + / - standard error ) and their mean age was 30.20 + / - 0.46 years . fifty-two of these women had primary infertility . three treatment protocols were evaluated . twenty-five women with unexplained infertility ( group a ) received low-dose bromocriptine ( 1.25 to 2.5 mg ) at bedtime for the first 18 days of the cycle ; 18 women with unexplained infertility ( group b ) received 100 mg of pyridoxine continuously ; and 16 women receiving clomiphene citrate ( group c ) also received bromocriptine in a manner similar to that for group a . all subjects were followed for six treatment cycles or until pregnancy occurred . the estimated cumulative pregnancy rate after six treatment cycles was 65 % for groups a and c , which is significantly higher than the 22 % rate for group b ( lee-desu statistic = 4.66 , p = 0.03 ) . women treated with bromocriptine were 2.3 times more likely to conceive than women treated with pyridoxine . furthermore , those infertile galactorrheic women whose random prolactin level was greater than or equal to 15 ng / ml were most likely to conceive . expressible galactorrhea in women with unexplained infertility and high normal prolactin concentrations may serve as a clinical sign indicating those women who may benefit from low-dose bromocriptine treatment administered at bedtime . 
assessment of the potency of orally administered progestins in women . the effects of at least three doses of each of five orally administered progestins on estrogen-primed , postmenopausal endometrial biochemistry and morphologic features were analyzed . the progestins tested were norethindrone , medroxyprogesterone acetate ( mpa ) , norgestrel , dydrogesterone , and progesterone . the dose required to elicit responses similar to those seen in premenopausal , secretory endometria was assessed for each of the parameters measured , and the relative potencies were calculated . potencies , relative to a value of 1 for norethindrone , are l norgestrel 8 ( d / l norgestrel 4 ) , mpa 0.1 , dydrogesterone 0.02 , and progesterone 0.002 . the dose of norethindrone required to elicit secretory phase activity was about 0.35 mg / day . these values agree with published data obtained with the use of different methods ( delay of menstruation in premenopausal women , endometrial histologic features of estrogen-primed , ovariectomized women ) . 
plasminogen in peritoneal fluid : a possible nonsteroidal indicator of ovulation . plasminogen levels in peritoneal fluid were evaluated in 40 fertile women with regular ovulatory cycles . fifteen samples were obtained before ovulation and 25 samples after ovulation . plasminogen content and concentration in postovulatory peritoneal fluid was 0.84 + / - 0.10 mg and 6.1 + / - 0.57 mg / dl , respectively . these values were significantly higher than in the preovulatory peritoneal fluid , which were 0.36 + / - 0.12 mg ( p less than 0.005 ) and 3.5 + / - 0.33 mg / dl , ( p less than 0.001 ) , respectively . estradiol and progesterone ( p ) concentrations in peritoneal fluid were significantly higher after ovulation ( p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 , respectively ) . p concentration in serum and peritoneal fluid showed a linear correlation ( p less than 0.05 ) . peritoneal fluid plasminogen is significantly elevated after ovulation and may be a nonsteroidal marker for follicular rupture and oocyte extrusion . 
serum and peritoneal fluid proteins in women with and without endometriosis . we examined the proteins in serum and peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis ( and of healthy controls ) for evidence of an autoimmune response that might account for their impaired fertility . no antibodies against endometrial glycoproteins or against " progestin dependent endometrial protein " ( pep ) were found in any serum or peritoneal fluid sample . levels of pep were not different in serum from women with moderate to severe endometriosis ( n = 6 ) , with mild endometriosis ( n = 21 ) , or from disease-free cycling controls ( n = 19 ) . pep levels in peritoneal fluid from mild endometriosis and from controls did not differ but were elevated ten times in fluid obtained in the secretory phase from women with moderate to severe disease . this suggests that pep levels in peritoneal fluid reflect the extent of ectopic endometrial growth . the salient finding was a heretofore undescribed protein ( mol wt 70 , 000 ) in secretory phase peritoneal fluid samples ( 18 / 20 ) and its absence during the proliferative phase ( 0 / 35 ) . 
prognostic factors influencing the pregnancy rate after microsurgical cornual anastomosis . eighty-two women with symmetric cornual blockage were selected for evaluation of the results of microsurgical anastomosis in relation to data from preoperative hysterosalpingography and histologic study of excised tubal specimens . serial sections from 164 occluded tubal portions were examined . the term pregnancy rate was 44 % . several prognostic factors influencing the postoperative pregnancy rate were revealed : maximized tubal length ; preserved intramural portion ; absence of chronic inflammation ; absence of tubal inclusion in the tubal wall ; and absence of tubal endometriosis . 
conservative laparoscopic treatment of 321 ectopic pregnancies . from 1974 to 1984 , 321 tubal pregnancies were treated conservatively with laparoscopic techniques . fifteen cases ( 4.8 % ) required a subsequent laparotomy or second laparoscopic procedure because of retained trophoblastic tissue . of 118 patients desiring subsequent pregnancy , 76 had an intrauterine pregnancy ( 64.4 % ) and 26 had a second ectopic pregnancy ( 22 % ) . eleven of 24 ( 45.8 % ) women attempting conception following conservative laparoscopic removal of an ectopic gestation from the sole remaining fallopian tube established an intrauterine pregnancy . in this same group , seven patients ( 29.2 % ) had a second ectopic pregnancy . the fertility results were also analyzed according to the previous history . the postoperative intrauterine pregnancy rate was 85.5 % among 62 patients without a history of infertility ( group i ) , compared with 41.1 % among 56 patients with a history of infertility or a previous ectopic pregnancy ( group ii ) . the subsequent ectopic pregnancy rate in group i was 16.1 % versus 28.6 % in group ii . this large series clearly demonstrates the relative safety and efficacy of conservative laparoscopic treatment of tubal pregnancies . 
sperm morphologic features as a prognostic factor in in vitro fertilization . to determine whether there is a prognostic value in the percentage normal sperm morphologic features in a human in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) program , the authors conducted a prospective study in women with bilateral tubal damage . based on the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa , the patients were divided into four groups : group i , normal morphologic features between 0 % and 14 % ; group ii , 15 % to 30 % ; group iii , 31 % to 45 % ; and group iv , 46 % to 60 % . one hundred ninety successful laparoscopic cycles were evaluated . in group i , 104 oocytes were obtained , of which 37 % fertilized , but no pregnancy resulted ; in group ii , 81 % of 324 oocytes were fertilized , with a pregnancy rate per embryo transfer ( et ) of 22 % ; in group iii , 82 % of 309 oocytes were fertilized , with a 31 % pregnancy rate ; and in group iv , 91 % of 69 oocytes were fertilized , with a pregnancy rate of 12 % . probability models indicated that there was a clear threshold in normal sperm morphologic features at 14 % , with high fertilization and pregnancy rate in the groups with normal sperm morphologic features greater than 14 % . 
a simple and effective technique for increasing pregnancy rates in couples with retrograde ejaculation . seven of 12 patients with retrograde ejaculation , who had at least occasional samples with reasonable sperm numbers and motility , underwent a protocol including luteinizing hormone-timed , intrauterine insemination with washed sperm recovered from the urine . seven pregnancies have occurred to date in six patients ; the one other patient is still early in the protocol period . the described technique for collecting sperm , ovulation timing , sperm recovery , and washing and intrauterine insemination are relatively simple and cost-effective and appear to be effective in contributing to pregnancies in many couples with retrograde ejaculation . 
a factor inhibiting ovum capture by the oviductal fimbriae present in endometriosis peritoneal fluid . the cumulus-fimbria interaction was investigated in vitro with endometriosis peritoneal fluid ( pf ) . on the oviductal fimbria of the golden hamster , incubated with endometriosis and nonendometriosis pf and culture medium 199 contained 4 % bovine serum albumin ( control ) , was placed the mouse oocyte-cumulus complex at 5-minute intervals for 60 to 70 minutes . incubation periods until the loss of fimbrial capability of ovum capture ( ovum capturability disappearance time [ ocdt ] ) were 23.3 + / - 2.7 ( standard error of the mean ) , 51.7 + / - 2.9 , and 61.3 + / - 0.9 minutes with endometriosis , nonendometriosis pf , and control , respectively . ocdt was significantly decreased with cell-free and ultrafiltrated endometriosis pf containing a molecular size greater than 100 , 000 ( 26.0 + / - 2.8 and 26.1 + / - 2.5 minutes , respectively ) . a factor inhibiting fimbrial capability of ovum capture is present in endometriosis pf . 
a new stirrable catheter for gamete intrafallopian tube transfer ( gift ) . cannulation of the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube during gamete intrafallopian tube transfer ( gift ) may be at times extremely difficult and even require minilaparotomy . an ideal laparoscopic gift catheter should be flexible and stirrable , have a small diameter , and yet be sturdy enough to enable its manipulation . such a catheter was developed in collaboration with cook ob / gyne , a division of cook inc . , indiana , with primary emphasis on easy laparoscopic manipulation . its use in eight attempts of gift resulted in three pregnancies ( 37 % ) . 
inhibin concentration in the culture media of human oocyte-cumulus-corona cell complexes is not related to subsequent embryo cleavage . we have demonstrated an in vitro secretion of inhibin by human occc , not related to subsequent egg cleavage . a putative signal , released by occc , that could modulate inhibin secretion by granulosa cells has not been discovered . inhibin secretion by occc has no predictive value concerning the further fertilization and cleavage of the oocytes . 
empty follicle syndrome . four patients who had no oocytes retrieved during an ivf cycle were studied in an attempt to identify predictors of such an occurrence and suggestions for its cause . all 30 follicles aspirated in five cycles in these four women yielded no oocytes . one patient had two cycles that produced no eggs . the empty follicle syndrome may represent a new syndrome and a cause of infertility . 
ureteral abnormalities in women with endometriosis . high-volume intravenous urography was performed in 63 women with surgically proven endometriosis . subtle abnormalities were found in 15.9 % of these women . no patient had urologic symptoms , and there was no evidence of hydroureter or ureteral obstruction on the ivp . long-term follow-up study will be required to determine whether or not these lesions will progress and cause ureteral obstruction . 
successful treatment of oligospermic and azoospermic men with alpha 1-blocker and beta-stimulator : new treatment for idiopathic male infertility . we studied the effect of oral administration of alpha 1-blocker and beta-stimulator on 20 idiopathically infertile men . bunazosin ( alpha 1-blocker , 2 mg / day ) and procaterol ( beta-stimulator , 100 micrograms / day ) were given orally twice daily for 5 months . the administration of alpha 1-blocker and beta-stimulator elicited an increase in sperm output and seminal volume in 16 patients ( 80 % ) . the increase in sperm output seems to be associated with relaxations of myoid cells , which lead to dilatation of stenotic areas of seminiferous tubules , occurring discontinuously , and subsequent maintenance of good tubular fluid flow . no adverse effects were observed in this series .

serial observations of colonic carcinogenesis in the rat . premalignant mucosa binds ulex europeus agglutinin . we evaluated certain histochemical tests for their ability to detect premalignant mucosa in the dimethylhydrazine model of colonic carcinogenesis . biweekly colonoscopic biopsies of the descending colon were performed for 29 wk in control and dimethylhydrazine-treated rats . biopsy specimens of the splenic flexure , rectum , and any visualized tumors were taken . the specimens were stained with periodic acid-schiff to detect neutral mucins , high-iron diamine alcian blue to detect sialylated and sulfated mucins , fluoresceinated peanut agglutinin , and fluoresceinated ulex europeus agglutinin . none of the first three tests consistently detected premalignant mucosa . however , ulex europeus agglutinin , which bound to only 3 % of control biopsy specimens throughout the course of the study , bound to increasing numbers of biopsy specimens in the dimethylhydrazine-treated animals , reaching a maximum of 90 % positivity by 13-16 wk . moreover , ulex europeus agglutinin bound strongly to all biopsy specimens from tissues adjacent to tumors and to 93 % of tumors . mucosal atrophy and focal dysplasia were present more frequently in specimens taken from the rectum ( but not the splenic flexure ) of dimethylhydrazine-treated animals than of control animals , but there was no correlation between the histochemical markers and either atrophy or dysplasia . we conclude that ulex europeus agglutinin binding is a consistent feature of premalignant colonic mucosa in dimethylhydrazine-treated rats . 
calcium channel blockers protect against ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions in rats . the current studies were designed to investigate the effect of calcium channel blockers on chemically induced gastric lesions in rats . results of this study indicate that pretreatment of male f344 rats with the calcium channel blockers verapamil , diltiazem , or mg2+ significantly protected against ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions as demonstrated by gross and histopathologic evaluation . treatment of rats with calcium channel blockers before ethanol or indomethacin administration resulted in a significant decline in the mean number of lesions per glandular stomach , the damaged area of the glandular stomach , and the severity of lesions . calcium channel blockers also caused a significant decline in the incidence of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions , but had no effect on the incidence of ethanol-induced gastric lesions . these results offer the first evidence that calcium channel blockers may play an important role in the protection against chemically induced gastric lesions and thereby offer insight into the mechanism of gastric ulcer formation . it is speculated that this knowledge may prove important in the development of new and improved therapies for the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers in humans . 
gastrointestinal features of culture-positive yersinia enterocolitica infection . yersinia enterocolitica was cultured from feces of 122 symptomatic adults in a single facility using selective culture media ; all isolates were confirmed in an independent reference laboratory . of 128 isolates , multiple serotypes were defined and all were biochemically typical for yersinia enterocolitica . other agents were seen in 20 patients ; of these , seven were yersinia fredriksenii and six were clostridium difficile . diarrhea ( 80 % ) and abdominal pain ( 64 % ) were common , whereas other features such as fever ( 9 % ) and bloody stools ( 8 % ) were unusual . use of antibiotics ( 24 % ) or opiates ( 28 % ) in the month before culture was common . the terminal ileum was seen radiographically in 20 patients , but only two barium studies showed abnormalities . fiberoptic endoscopy and biopsy studies , done in greater than 50 % of the cases , showed minimal or no changes in most patients . however , 3 patients had pseudomembranous colitis with concomitant clostridium difficile cytotoxin and 7 had diffuse severe colitis . new culture techniques , and possibly geographic differences , have contributed to the high isolation rates of this organism . yersinia enterocolitica occurs sporadically , involves a variety of serotypes , and is associated with a broader clinical spectrum than was formerly appreciated . 
barrett 's esophagus . a prevalent , occult complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease . a prospective study of patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux was undertaken to determine the prevalence of barrett 's esophagus and reevaluate the diagnostic approach necessary to detect this complication . endoscopy with mucosal biopsy was performed in 97 subjects . twelve ( 12.4 % ) were found to have barrett 's esophagus . the sensitivity and specificity of the endoscopic and radiologic examinations for barrett 's esophagus were prospectively evaluated . endoscopy ( 92 % ) was significantly more sensitive than radiology ( 24 % ) in detecting barrett 's esophagus ( p less than 0.001 ) . the frequency and severity of reflux symptoms among patients determined to have barrett 's esophagus , reflux esophagitis , or normal esophageal biopsies were quantitatively similar in all three groups , except for significantly greater daytime heartburn in those with reflux esophagitis ( p less than 0.01 ) . these data indicate that barrett 's esophagus complicates gastroesophageal reflux more often than previously believed . 
role of nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency . patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency may absorb greater than 50 % of dietary fat despite the absence of measurable pancreatic lipase activity . nonpancreatic lipolytic activity was measured in gastric and duodenal aspirates from 5 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency secondary to alcoholism and in aspirates from 5 alcoholics without evidence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction ( controls ) . samples were collected under fasting and postprandial conditions . all patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency had nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in gastric and duodenal aspirates . lipolytic activity in gastric aspirates was not significantly different between the patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the controls during the fasting and postprandial periods . pancreatic insufficiency was associated with significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) higher nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in the duodenum under fasting conditions . no significant difference between the groups was found in postprandial nonpancreatic lipolytic activity . nonpancreatic lipolytic activity accounted for approximately 90 % of total lipolytic activity at the ligament of treitz in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as opposed to 7 % in the control subjects . these observations suggest a significant role for nonpancreatic lipolytic activity ( lingual lipase and gastric lipase ) in fat digestion in patients with pancreatic insufficiency secondary to chronic alcohol abuse . 
ethanol-induced damage to mucosal capillaries of rat stomach . ultrastructural features and effects of prostaglandin f2 beta and cysteamine . impairment of the mucosal microcirculation may contribute to ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage . in this report , we describe diffuse and severe ultrastructural damage to the capillaries of the gastric glandular mucosa of the rat that occurred within 1 min after intragastric instillation of 100 % ethanol . there was a gradient of damage in that endothelial cell structure was most severely disrupted in profiles of capillaries located close to the luminal surface but some morphologic evidence of damage was evident in the wall of capillary profiles to a mean depth of 256 micron . capillary structure was generally normal in the deeper regions of the mucosa . pretreatment with intragastric cysteamine , 30 mg / 100 g , or intragastric prostaglandin f2 beta , 0.5 mg / 100 g , significantly reduced the depth in the mucosa to which damage to capillaries extended . pretreatment with intragastric prostaglandin f2 beta , 0.2 mg / 100 g , afforded no significant protection . we conclude that a 1-min exposure to 100 % ethanol induces striking damage to the microcirculation of glandular mucosa of the rat stomach with severe damage to capillary profiles near the lumen and sparing of capillary profiles near the muscularis mucosa , and pretreatment with the sulfhydryl agent , cysteamine , or with a large dose of prostaglandin f2 beta reduces the extent of but does not abolish ethanol-induced damage to gastric mucosal capillaries . 
identification and mechanism of delayed esophageal acid clearance in subjects with hiatus hernia . to determine if hiatus hernia ( hh ) contributes to the delayed clearance of acid from the esophagus in patients with gastroesophageal reflux ( ger ) , we performed simultaneous esophageal ph recordings and radionuclide studies in three study populations : 12 ger patients with hh , 5 ger patients with no hh , and 8 subjects with hh but no ger symptoms . acid clearance was measured at 5 cm . above the manometrically located lower esophageal sphincter ( les ) after injecting a 15-ml . bolus of 0.1 n hcl at 15 cm . above the les . the acid was labeled with 200 mu ci of 99mtc-sulfur colloid . acid clearance was also measured at 10 cm . above the les after injection of a 15-ml . bolus of 0.1 n hcl at 20 cm . above the les . acid clearance at 5 cm . above the les was faster in ger patients with no hh compared to ger patients with hh and asymptomatic hh subjects . acid clearance was faster at 10 cm . than 5 cm . above the les in all hh and non-hh subjects studied . in non-hh subjects , each swallow resulted in an increase in ph ( a monophasic ph response ) at 5 and 10 cm . above the les . in symptomatic as well as asymptomatic hh subjects , swallows resulted in an initial fall followed by a rise in ph at 5 cm . above the les ( a biphasic ph response ) . radionuclide studies showed reflux of the isotope-labeled acid into the esophagus followed by clearance ( a biphasic response ) accompanying swallows in 15 of the 20 hh subjects . swallow-induced reflux was not detected by radionuclide scanning in non-hh subjects . based on these observations , we conclude that during acid clearance a small amount of acid is trapped in the hh sac and refluxes into the esophagus during subsequent swallows when there is relaxation of the les , and these repeated episodes of acid reflux from the hh account for the delayed acid clearance observed in ger patients with hh . 
effect of peptide chain length on absorption of egg protein hydrolysates in the normal human jejunum . the influence of the peptide chain length of partial enzymic hydrolysates of protein on nitrogen and amino acid absorption was studied in 12 subjects using a jejunal perfusion technique . three hydrolysates of egg white and an equivalent amino acid mixture were perfused at 30 mmol / l and 100 mmol / l in two separate experiments . two hydrolysates ( oh1 and oh2 ) contained mainly dipeptides and tripeptides , whereas the third ( oh3 ) comprised tripeptide to pentapeptides as judged chromatographically . nitrogen absorption was significantly slower from the higher chain length mixture , oh3 , than from the short chain mixtures , oh1 and oh2 , at both concentrations . similarly , several amino acid residues were absorbed less well from oh3 than from oh1 and oh2 . these data demonstrate that the chain length of heterogeneous mixtures of peptides affects absorption of nitrogen and individual amino acid residues , and suggest that brush border hydrolysis of tetrapeptides and pentapeptides limits absorption from enzymic hydrolysates of protein which simulate the composition of the postprandial luminal contents . 
immunochemical , electrophoretic , and genetic heterogeneity of pepsinogen i . characterization with monoclonal antibodies . two immunologic subclasses of human pepsinogen i alpha-pg i and beta-pg i , have been identified based on their reactivity toward a murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope on the alpha-pg i isozymogens . the antibody was used to purify the major alpha- and beta-isozymogens from gastric mucosa and to determine their contributions to the previously described genetic polymorphism of pg i . the alpha-epitope was localized to the pepsin region of the molecules . the two major alpha-pg i isozymogens ( pg 3 alpha and pg 5 alpha ) and the major beta-pg i isozymogen ( pg 4 beta ) were demonstrated to contain net charge differences located in the respective pepsin and activation peptide regions . we propose that the alpha- and beta-subclasses contain net charge amino acid substitutions encoded by the corresponding pepsinogen genes : pga3 , pga4 , and pga5 . 
studies of the prevalence and significance of radiolabeled bile acid malabsorption in a group of patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea . we studied radiolabeled fecal bile acid excretion in 11 normal subjects and 17 patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea for three major purposes : to establish normal values for this test in the presence of increased stool volumes ( induced in normal subjects by ingestion of poorly absorbable solutions ) ; to test for bile acid malabsorption in the patients and to correlate this with an independent test of ileal function , the schilling test ; and to compare the results of the bile acid excretion test with the subsequent effect of a bile acid binding agent ( cholestyramine ) on stool weight . in normal subjects fecal excretion of the radiolabel was increased with increasing stool volumes . as a group , patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea excreted radiolabeled bile acid more rapidly than normal subjects with induced diarrhea ( t1 / 2 56 + / - 8 vs . 236 + / - 60 h , respectively , p less than 0.005 ) . there was a statistically significant positive correlation between t1 / 2 of radiolabeled bile acid and schilling test results in these patients . although 14 of 17 patients absorbed labeled taurocholic acid less well than any of the normal subjects with comparable volumes of induced diarrhea , cholestyramine had no statistically significant effect on stool weight in the patient group , and in none of the patients was stool weight reduced to within the normal range . in summary , most patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea have bile acid malabsorption ( as measured by fecal excretion of labeled bile acid ) , but they do not respond to cholestyramine therapy with a significant reduction in stool weight . although the significance of these findings was not clearly established , the most likely interpretation is that bile acid malabsorption is a manifestation of an underlying intestinal motility or absorptive defect rather than the primary cause of diarrhea . 
effect of cisapride on gastric emptying of indigestible solids in patients with gastroparesis diabeticorum . a comparison with metoclopramide and placebo . cisapride is a prokinetic agent believed to facilitate acetylcholine release from the myenteric plexus of the gut . the effect of cisapride on gastric emptying of solids was studied in 9 diabetic patients , all of whom had delayed gastric emptying of indigestible solids ( gastroparesis ) . six patients had chronic nausea and vomiting , and 3 had no symptoms . cisapride ( 5 mg ) was given intravenously 15 min before ingestion of a 400-kcal test meal and 10 indigestible solid radiopaque markers . on separate days and in random order each patient also received intravenous metoclopramide ( 10 mg ) or placebo 15 min before ingestion of the meal and markers . mean gastric emptying of radiopaque markers , assessed by serial radiographs of the gastric region , was accelerated by metoclopramide and cisapride , but the difference reached significance only with cisapride ( p less than 0.05 ) . there was considerable intersubject variability in gastric emptying responses to cisapride and metoclopramide . no side effects occurred with either drug . this study indicates that acute , intravenous administration of cisapride accelerates gastric emptying of indigestible solids in patients with diabetic gastroparesis . 
regional and cellular heterogeneity of cholecystokinin receptors mediating muscle contraction in the gut [ published erratum appears in gastroenterology 1987 jun ; 92 ( 6 ) : 2055 ] the contractile action of cholecystokinin ( cck ) on smooth muscle of the gut is either direct ( gallbladder and gastric fundus ) or both direct and neurally mediated ( small intestine ) . these regional differences were used to characterize pharmacologically cck receptors on smooth muscle cells and neurons of the gastric fundus , gallbladder , and ileum of the guinea pig . in circular and longitudinal ileal smooth muscle , tetrodotoxin was used to separate direct from neurally mediated contractile effects . cholecystokinin receptors on smooth muscle cells were found in all locations . the muscle cells displayed a decreasing order of sensitivity to the c-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin as expressed in the median doses , and to the selective cholecystokinin antagonist , proglumide , as expressed in the inhibitory dissociation constants . the median doses of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin ranged from 5.5 nm in gallbladder muscle to 185 nm in circular ileal muscle ; the corresponding inhibitory dissociation constants of proglumide ranged from 180 to 437 microm [ corrected ] . cholecystokinin receptors on cholinergic neurons were confined to circular and longitudinal ileal muscle ; the neurons were 80-300 times more sensitive to the octapeptide of cholecystokinin ( d50 's 0.5 and 2.3 nm ) than the corresponding muscle cells , and 19-21 times more sensitive to proglumide ( inhibitory dissociation constants , 20 microm [ corrected ] ) . the results provide clear evidence of cellular heterogeneity of cholecystokinin receptors ( i.e. , difference in sensitivity between muscle cells and neurons from the same location ) as well as regional heterogeneity ( i.e. , difference in sensitivity between muscle cells from various locations ) . 
colonoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease . diagnostic accuracy and proposal of an endoscopic score . colonoscopy is used in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease but its accuracy and the " weight " of the various endoscopic signs have not been assessed . in a prospective study 357 patients with 606 colonoscopies , in whom the endoscopic appearances were those of ulcerative colitis , crohn 's colitis , or indeterminate colitis , were followed-up for an average period of 22 mo . a final , definite , endoscopy-independent diagnosis was reached by means of autopsy , surgery , or histology on biopsy in 71 % of patients . accuracy of colonoscopy was 89 % , with 4 % errors and 7 % indeterminate diagnoses . errors were more frequent in severe inflammatory activity ( 9 % ) . the most useful endoscopic features in this differential diagnosis were discontinuous involvement , anal lesions , and cobblestoning of mucosa for crohn 's disease , and erosions or microulcers and granularity for ulcerative colitis . after selecting the endoscopic features with best predictive value , an " endoscopic score " was calculated by means of " likelihood ratios . " 
correlation of hepatitis b virus dna and antigens in the liver . a study in chronic liver disease . hepatitis b virus deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) and antigens ( hbsag and hbcag ) were studied in liver biopsy specimens from 105 hbsag-positive patients with chronic liver diseases . free or integrated viral dna , or both , was detected in 83 of 105 ( 79 % ) patients , whereas hbsag and hbcag were demonstrated immunohistologically in 96 ( 91 % ) and 39 ( 37 % ) , respectively . of 60 patients with detectable free viral dna , 38 ( 63 % ) were positive for hbcag , whereas only 1 of 45 ( 2 % ) with either integrated viral dna alone ( n = 23 ) or no detectable viral dna ( n = 22 ) was positive for hbcag ( p less than 0.001 ) . furthermore , the amount of hbcag was positively correlated with the amount of free viral dna in the liver tissue . in contrast , hbsag was well expressed not only in the liver with free viral dna , but also in the liver with integrated dna . these data suggest that the synthesis of hbcag is primarily directed by free viral dna , whereas that of hbsag may be directed by free as well as integrated viral dnas . 
hepatic uptake of sex steroids in men with alcoholic cirrhosis . we attempted to determine to what extent the degree of liver function impairment might affect the hepatic uptake and , as a consequence , alter the systemic plasma levels of endogenous sex steroids in male patients with alcoholic cirrhosis . the plasma levels and hepatic uptake of the steroids dehydroepiandrosterone , androstenedione , testosterone , dihydrotestosterone , estrone , estradiol , progesterone , and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were assessed . systemic plasma levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone were significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) reduced , whereas those of androstenedione , estrone , and estradiol were significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) elevated in men with alcoholic cirrhosis when compared to controls . sex hormone binding globulin levels were also significantly elevated ( p less than 0.01 ) . the hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the degree of liver function impairment as shown by the linear significant relationship between their hepatic extractions and that of indocyanine green ( r = 0.74-0.92 , p less than 0.05 ; except for dihydrotestosterone , r = 0.17 , not significant ) . in addition , the hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the binding affinity to sex hormone binding globulin . the higher the affinity for sex hormone binding globulin , the lower the hepatic uptake influenced by liver function impairment . it was estimated that hepatic clearances accounted for only 20 % -50 % of the metabolic clearance of sex steroids . no significant relationship between plasma levels of sex steroids and their hepatic clearance was found . we show here that in alcoholic cirrhosis the extent of hepatic uptake of sex steroids depends partly on the degree of liver function impairment and partly on the degree to which they are bound to sex hormone binding globulin . production rate or peripheral metabolism , or both , rather than hepatic uptake alone may account for the altered circulating levels of sex steroids . 
prognosis of alcoholic cirrhosis in the presence and absence of alcoholic hepatitis . liver biopsy specimens ( 178 percutaneous and 39 transjugular ) were assessed from 217 consecutive patients with alcoholic liver disease , 77 noncirrhotics and 140 cirrhotics , whose cases were followed for 5 yr . cirrhotic patients were categorized into two groups , with and without " hepatitis " using a criteria to define " hepatitis " that included only degrees of inflammation , necrosis , and mallory bodies that had a prognostic weight in terms of mortality in 1 yr . this classification resulted in a sharp separation between a group of 42 patients with cirrhosis without " hepatitis " and with low mortality , both at 1 yr ( 7.1 % + / - 4.0 % ) and at 5 yr ( 31 % + / - 7 % ) , and another group of 98 patients with cirrhosis and " hepatitis " and a high mortality both at 1 yr ( 26.5 % + / - 4.5 % , p less than 0.01 ) , and at 5 yr ( 47 % + / - 5 % , p less than 0.02 ) . importantly , the 1-yr mortality in patients with cirrhosis and no " hepatitis " was not statistically different from that of patients with no cirrhosis or " hepatitis " ( most of whom had only fatty liver ) both at 1 yr ( 6.9 % + / - 3.3 % ) and at 5 yr ( 24 % + / - 6 % ) . there were marked differences in several variables between cirrhosis with and without " hepatitis " [ combined clinical and laboratory index : no " hepatitis " : 4.9 + / - 0.7 , with " hepatitis " : 7.8 + / - 0.5 , p less than 0.01 ; score of collagen in space of disse : no " hepatitis " : 2.1 + / - 0.4 , with " hepatitis " : 3.7 + / - 0.3 , p less than 0.01 ; hepatocyte cross-sectional surface area : no " hepatitis " : 682 + / - 51 micron 2 , with " hepatitis " : 841 + / - 31 micron 2 , p less than 0.01 ] . these findings were more severe in the transjugular group than in the percutaneous group . collagen in the space of disse and hepatocyte surface area were not statistically different when cirrhosis without " hepatitis " was compared with a similar no " hepatitis " group of patients having noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease . in this patient sample the presence of parenchymal nodules and fibrous septa , per se , did not result in an increase in mortality with respect to alcoholic patients without cirrhosis and with no " hepatitis . " 
sustained remission after corticosteroid therapy of severe hepatitis b surface antigen-negative chronic active hepatitis . to determine the frequency of a sustained remission and to assess the long-term prognosis of relapse and retreatment , 66 patients with severe hepatitis b surface antigen-negative chronic active hepatitis and prolonged follow-up after initial corticosteroid withdrawal ( mean , 10 + / - 0.4 yr ) were evaluated . selection of patients was made from among 206 cases of severe disease . twenty-four patients ( 36 % ) sustained remission for at least 5 yr ( mean , 11 + / - 0.6 yr ) after initial therapy , and 42 ( 64 % ) relapsed and were retreated . patients who sustained remission had shorter durations of illness before therapy ( 8 + / - 1 vs . 14 + / - 2 mo , p less than 0.05 ) and they had greater laboratory improvements during treatment . the frequencies of cirrhosis and death were not significantly greater in patients who relapsed . of the 42 patients who relapsed , 9 ( 21 % ) ultimately entered a sustained remission after retreatment . remission for at least 5 yr was possible in 33 of the 66 patients ( 50 % ) . major drug complications developed more commonly in those who relapsed and required retreatment ( 59 % vs . 29 % , p less than 0.05 ) . we conclude that 50 % of patients who enter remission during initial therapy may ultimately achieve a sustained remission , especially if their disease is of short duration and adequately suppressed during treatment . relapse does not affect long-term prognosis , but retreatment is associated with more side effects . 
chronic ischemic gastritis reversed after revascularization operation . a patient with severe chronic gastritis and duodenitis that clinically and endoscopically disappeared after an intestinal revascularization procedure is reported . chronic intestinal ischemia appears to be a cause of gastritis as seen in this patient . 
polypoid synovial sarcoma of the esophagus . pure sarcomas of the esophagus are exceedingly rare . we report a case of esophageal synovial sarcoma which occurred in an adolescent . the tumor was locally resected , sparing the patient esophagectomy . after postoperative radiation therapy , the patient remains alive and well without evidence of disease 28 mo after operation . the unique nature of polypoid sarcoma of the esophagus , and the potential for cure without esophagectomy , is discussed . 
sex steroid receptors in the stomach , liver , pancreas , and gastrointestinal tract of the baboon . sex steroids have been shown to have a marked effect on the physiologic activities of the liver and the gastrointestinal tract . we performed autoradiographic studies using [ 3h ] estradiol and [ 3h ] dihydrotestosterone on male and female baboons for the purpose of identifying estrogen or androgen receptors , or both , in the liver , pancreas , stomach , and small and large intestines of baboons . evidence for the presence of estrogen and androgen receptors was made apparent by high concentrations of silver grains over the nuclei of the cells of these tissues . androgen receptors were largely confined to the nuclei of the smooth muscle cells of the tunica muscularis of the gut wall and the connective tissue interstitial cells of the liver , pancreas , stomach , and intestines . estrogen receptors were prominent in the nuclei of the vascular smooth muscle cells in the liver , pancreas , gut , and the majority of the endocrine islet cells . these observations suggest that a variety of different cell types of the liver , pancreas , and gastrointestinal tract contain estrogen and androgen receptors that might modulate their cellular activities and influence several different physiologic processes . 
mesenteric vein thrombosis as presenting manifestation of hereditary protein s deficiency . protein s deficiency is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait . heterozygotes with a reduction of 50 % in the plasma protein s concentration are at risk for the development of venous thromboembolism , often occurring at an early age without an apparent cause . in the majority of the patients thrombosis is restricted to the superficial or deep venous system of the legs . in this case report we describe the presence of mesenteric vein thrombosis in a 30-yr-old man with hereditary protein s deficiency . in his family protein s deficiency was also recognized in his mother , brother , and niece . both his mother and brother had a history of thrombotic disease .

simplified assessment of segmental colonic transit . transit times of radiopaque markers through the human gut were measured by published techniques and compared with a simplified method . three sets of distinctive markers were ingested by 24 healthy persons on 3 successive days . in the first part of the study , daily abdominal x-rays were taken and individual stools were collected for radiography . mouth-to-anus transits were assessed from the fecal output of markers and mean colonic and segmental colonic transits were calculated from the daily radiographs . these established methods were then compared with estimates of total colonic and segmental transits based on a single abdominal film , taken on the fourth day . the single-film technique correlated well with values obtained from the previous , but more inconvenient , methods . using the simpler approach , colonic transit was assessed in 49 additional healthy subjects , for a total group of 73. total colonic transit was 35.0 + / - 2.1 h ( mean + / - se ) ; segmental transits was 11.3 + / - 1.1 h for the right colon , 11.4 + / - 1.4 h for the left colon , and 12.4 + / - 1.1 h for the rectosigmoid . men had significantly shorter transits for the whole colon than did women ( p less than 0.05 ) , and this difference was apparent to some extent in the right ( p = 0.06 ) and left colon ( p = 0.07 ) but not in the rectosigmoid . age did not influence transit significantly nor did a small dose of supplemental fiber . the technique is simple , convenient for clinical usage , and reduces the exposure to radiation to acceptable levels . there should be a role for this approach in the evaluation of colonic transit in selected patients . 
prostaglandin regulation of colonic blood flow in rabbit colitis . human and experimental colitis are associated with release of both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator eicosanoids . to determine the pattern of colonic blood flow in vivo and the role of prostaglandins and thromboxanes , immune complex-mediated colitis and delayed hypersensitivity-mediated colitis were induced in rabbits . organ blood flow was determined in conscious animals by radiolabeled microspheres before and after cyclooxygenase or thromboxane synthetase inhibition . colonic blood flow was twofold higher in colitis than in control animals . thromboxane synthetase inhibition with dazoxiben caused a slight further increase of colon perfusion in animals with colitis , but thromboxane receptor blockade had no effect . prostaglandin inhibition with indomethacin and ibuprofen did not affect blood flow in controls , but in animals with colitis these drugs markedly reduced colonic blood flow to the level of control animals . the data demonstrate that vasodilatory prostaglandins enhance colonic blood flow in acute colon inflammation . 
adherence to and penetration of the intestinal epithelium by reovirus type 1 in neonatal mice . in 10-day-old suckling and adult mice , reovirus type 1 adheres selectively to and penetrates membranous epithelial ( m ) cells . to determine when m cells first appear , when they first transport reovirus , and if reovirus adheres to and is endocytosed by other epithelial cells in the first postnatal week , we examined neonatal mouse intestine by transmission electron microscopy after reovirus type 1 exposure . at 2 days m cells accounted for 0.9 % of dome epithelial cells . by 9 days m cells had increased to 7.4 % . reovirus type 1 adherence to the surface of villus and dome epithelial cells showed marked variation in 2-6-day-old animals , but by 7 days only a few absorptive cell profiles had adherent reovirus . adherence to greater than 50 % of m-cell profiles occurred in all but 2 animals , but adherence to the majority of peyer 's patch absorptive cell profiles was present only in some 4- and 5-day-old animals . adherence to a majority of undifferentiated cell profiles occurred in some animals at all ages . membranous epithelial cells endocytosed reovirus at all ages but only at 2 days did rare villus and dome absorptive cells endocytose reovirus into the apical cytoplasm . thus , adherence of reovirus to the apical surface of mucosal epithelial cells is nonselective in newborn mice but becomes more selective within the first postnatal week with adherence by day 7 to most m-cell profiles , to a substantial but variable number of undifferentiated cell profiles , but to few absorptive cell profiles . 
spectral analysis of tachygastria recorded during motion sickness . the purpose of the present experiment was to study frequency changes in gastric myoelectric activity of healthy human subjects and the development of symptoms of motion sickness as brought about by vection or illusory self-motion . fifteen fasted healthy human subjects were seated inside a circular vection drum , the rotation of which produces visual signals of self-motion that are in conflict with vestibular signals ( i.e. , mismatched sensory input ) . an electrogastrogram was obtained for three 15-min . periods : baseline , rotation , and after drum rotation stopped . respiration , symptoms volunteered by subjects , and a continuous measure of intensity of symptoms were recorded . five subjects showed a continuation of normal 3-cycles / min . activity during drum rotation and reported no symptoms of motion sickness . ten subjects showed a shift of their dominant gastric frequency from 3 cycles / min . to 4-9 cycles / min . during drum rotation and reported symptoms of motion sickness . running spectral analysis revealed a close correspondence over time between tachygastria and reports of symptoms of motion sickness . 
modern hearing assistance : physicians are the ' gateway ' [ editorial ] 
will generic sustitution affect quality of geriatric care ? 
what causes falls ? a logical diagnostic procedure . any fall in the elderly may signal impending major illness . falls may be caused by any acute or chronic illness that causes weakness or dizziness . mi , stroke , or gi bleeding may well present with falls . a fall can be the first sign of urinary tract , respiratory , or gallbladder infection . avoid open-ended questions , such as " what happened ? " patients often state they slipped or tripped--possibly not the true reason for the fall . direct questions about symptoms ( " did you have difficulty in walking ? " or " did you feel dizzy ? " ) elicit more specific information . 
back pain in the elderly : updated diagnosis and management . ct of compression fractures is a useful adjunct to the plain x-ray in excluding signs of metastasis . however , increased bone density on ct may not distinguish osteoporotic fractures from neoplastic disease , in which case radioiodine scan , bone and marrow biopsies , or myelography may be necessary . surgery for painful osteoarthritic spinal disease is controversial . the potential advantages of surgery must be weighted against the risk of anesthesia , the length and tolerance of postoperative immobility , and the effect of laminectomy and fusion on the biomechanics of the spine . furthermore , the elderly are at increased risk for postoperative complications . 
restoring hearing to the older patient : the physician 's role . there is growing evidence that failure to diagnose and manage hearing problems early in their course results in significant and--to some extent--irreversible sensory deprivation . the primary care physician should routinely screen patients over age 50 for pure-tone sensitivity as part of the general physical examination . battery-operated , in-office , limited-frequency audiometers are available for under $ 350.

oesophageal and gastric motility disorders in patients categorised as having primary anorexia nervosa . gastrointestinal motor function in patients with primary anorexia nervosa has rarely been investigated . we studied oesophageal motor activity in 30 consecutive patients meeting standard diagnostic criteria for primary anorexia nervosa ( feighner et al ; dsm iii ) . seven were found to suffer from achalasia instead of primary anorexia nervosa , one from diffuse oesophageal spasm and one from severe gastro-oesophageal reflux and upper oesophageal sphincter hypertonicity , while partly non-propulsive and repetitive high amplitude , long duration contractions prevailed in the lower oesophagus of another six . in four patients with oesophageal dysmotility not responding to therapy and in 12 of 15 patients with normal oesophageal manometry , gastric emptying of a semisolid meal was studied . emptying was normal in only three but markedly delayed in 13 cases ( half emptying times 97-330 min , median : 147 min , as compared with 21-119 min , median : 47 min , in 24 healthy controls ) . in eight patients , the effects of domperidone 10 mg iv and placebo were compared under random double blind conditions . half emptying times were shortened significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) by domperidone . conclusions : symptoms of disordered upper gastrointestinal motor activity may be mistaken as indicating primary anorexia nervosa ; clinical evaluation of patients with presumed primary anorexia nervosa should rule out the possibility that disordered oesophageal motor activity underlies the symptoms ; delayed gastric emptying is a frequent feature in primary anorexia nervosa and might be returned to normal with domperidone . 
gastro-oesophageal reflux in the irritable bowel syndrome . symptomatic assessment and oesophageal investigations were done in 25 consecutive patients with the irritable bowel syndrome attending a gastroenterological clinic . symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux , dysphagia , and a globus sensation were significantly commoner than in a control group of fracture clinic patients . ambulatory oesophageal ph monitoring showed clearly abnormal reflux in 11 of 22 patients ( 50 % ) . nine patients had macroscopic endoscopic changes and a further 11 biopsy changes alone , of oesophagitis which was thus present in 80 % overall . lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was significantly less in irritable bowel patients than in age and sex matched controls , but upper oesophageal sphincter pressure was comparable in the two groups and disordered peristalsis was not found . oesophageal symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome are mainly caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux predisposed to by a subnormal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure , rather than by oesophageal spasm . 
campylobacter like organisms in duodenal and antral endoscopic biopsies : relationship to inflammation . in 66 endoscopic duodenal biopsies studied retrospectively and in 84 paired duodenal and antral biopsies assessed prospectively campylobacter like organisms were seen in 22 ( 33 % ) of the retrospectively examined duodenal biopsies and in 61 ( 73 % ) examined prospectively , and in 70 ( 83 % ) of antral biopsies . in the duodenum the organisms were mostly confined to the surface epithelium in areas showing gastric metaplasia , while in the antrum they were also found within superficial glands . a strong association was shown between the presence of campylobacter like organisms and histological active duodenal inflammation . 
dietary salt and gastric ulcer [ published erratum appears in gut 1986 dec ; 27 ( 12 ) : 1523 ] statistically significant linear correlations between geographic variations in salt consumption and mortality from gastric , but not duodenal ulcer , are reported . it is suggested that dietary consumption of salt is a risk factor in mortality from gastric ulcer . 
dose related in vitro effects of ranitidine and cimetidine on basal and acth-stimulated steroidogenesis . isolated bovine adrenocortical cells were incubated with and without 3 ng / ml acth , with various concentrations ( 10-1000 micrograms / ml ) of either cimetidine or ranitidine . cortisol , corticosterone , and deoxycorticosterone outputs were measured . cimetidine and ranitidine at 320 and 1000 micrograms / ml inhibited acth-stimulated corticosterone and cortisol synthesis and cimetidine decreased basal cortisol synthesis . the inhibitory effects of cimetidine on cortisol synthesis were approximately 10 times greater than those of ranitidine . cimetidine ( 1000 micrograms / ml ) , but not ranitidine increased deoxycorticosterone synthesis by acth-stimulated cells , indicating inhibition of 11 beta-hydroxylation in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway . although doses of cimetidine and ranitidine which produce these in vitro effects are much greater than plasma concentrations in normal clinical use , they might be important in acutely ill patients given intravenous bolus injections of cimetidine , or if either antagonist were accumulated by the adrenal to produce high intracellular concentrations . 
influence of sham feeding on salt and water absorption in the human jejunum . vagal stimulation induced by sham feeding in 11 healthy subjects was used to examine the possibility that the autonomic nervous system might be involved in the control of human jejunal absorption . gastric acid secretion was measured from gastric aspirates corrected for recovery , and jejunal absorption was determined using a triple lumen perfusion technique . sham feeding induced a significant increase in gastric acid secretion from 1.29 to 7.73 mmol / h ( p less than 0.02 ) . jejunal absorption of water decreased significantly from 41.0 to 26.8 ml / 30cm / h ( p less than 0.02 ) , sodium from 2.60 to 0.74 mmol / 30cm / h ( p less than 0.05 , and chloride from 2.68 to 0.74 mmol / 30cm / h ( p less than 0.02 ) . during the hour after sham feeding gastric acid secretion and jejunal absorption returned towards basal values . these results suggest that vagal stimulation may have influenced jejunal absorption of salt and water in man and supports the possibility that the autonomic nervous system has a physiological role in the control of intestinal mucosal function . 
immunoglobulin production by coeliac biopsies in organ culture . the production of immunoglobulins by jejunal mucosa during organ culture has been studied . in 18 untreated coeliac patients the amounts of iga , secretory iga and igm in the culture medium were higher than in those from 17 normal controls . the results in 15 treated coeliac patients did not differ from the control subjects . mucosal biopsies from patients with serum iga deficiency produced very little iga , but large amounts of igg and igm . the addition of neither frazer 's gluten fraction iii , nor alpha-gliadin to the culture system stimulated any additional increased secretion of immunoglobulins from the untreated coeliac patients . production of iga and igm by the small bowel mucosa continues during organ culture , but that of igg appears insignificant . 
absorption capacity of fructose in healthy adults . comparison with sucrose and its constituent monosaccharides . the capacity to absorb fructose in 10 healthy adults was investigated by means of hydrogen breath analysis . fructose absorption was quantified with lactulose standards . significant hydrogen production ( greater than or equal to 20 ppm rise of breath hydrogen ) was found after challenge with 10 % solutions of 50 , 37.5 , 25 , 20 , and 15 g fructose in eight , seven , five , four and one subjects , respectively . one subject showed malabsorption after a 10 g dose and possibly also 5 g fructose . in contrast , no malabsorption could be detected in any of the 10 subjects after ingestion of 100 g , 75 g , or 50 g sucrose or a mixture of 50 g glucose and 50 g fructose . after ingestion of mixtures of 50 g fructose +25 g glucose and 50 g fructose +12.5 g glucose malabsorption was present in three and seven subjects , respectively . symptoms during all challenges were mild , or absent . it is concluded that in the healthy state the absorption capacity of fructose given alone ranges from less than 5 g to more than 50 g . the absorption capacity of fructose given as sucrose is much higher . glucose stimulates fructose uptake in a dose dependent fashion . the possible existence of more than one intestinal transport system for fructose is considered . the elucidation of the clinical relevance of the findings is important . 
faecal metronidazole concentrations during oral and intravenous therapy for antibiotic associated colitis due to clostridium difficile . faecal metronidazole and hydroxymetronidazole concentrations measured by high pressure liquid chromatography are reported during 10 episodes of clostridium difficile colitis in nine patients . bactericidal faecal concentrations were present in all patients with acute disease receiving oral or intravenous metronidazole , and all responded to therapy . metronidazole and hydroxymetronidazole concentrations fell as the diarrhoea improved and neither substance was detectable in the faeces of five patients after recovery . this demonstration of intracolonic therapeutic concentrations of metronidazole supports the clinical experience of oral metronidazole being effective in the treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhoea caused by c difficile and also suggests a potential role for intravenous metronidazole in this disease . 
studies of the free faecal amines of infants with gastroenteritis and of healthy infants . the free primary amines present in the faeces of 44 infants ( 1-18 months ) with gastroenteritis have been examined by field desorption mass spectrometry of the lactone form of their fluorescamine derivatives without their prior separation . p-tyramine , 2-phenylethylamine , the diamines , putrescine and cadaverine and several of their acyl derivatives were common constituents , but a number of other amines were also characterised . using thin layer chromatography and field desorption mass spectrometry of the amine dansyl derivatives a comparative study was made of the faecal amines of 13 selected infants with gastroenteritis ( diarrhoea ) and of 13 healthy infants . p-tyramine , the most abundant amine , was significantly higher ( p = 0.02 ) in the sick infants . the overall presence of p-tyramine was more significantly related to the diet of the infants . faecal tyramine was low in breast fed infants but significantly higher ( p = 0.01 ) in infants fed cow 's milk . 
cholecystectomy and adenomatous polyps of the large bowel . seventy two patients ( 39 women ) with colonic adenomas were compared with 72 adenoma free controls ( 39 women ) to investigate the possible association between previous cholecystectomy and the subsequent development of adenomas . data were gathered retrospectively from medical records . overall there was no significant association between colonic adenomas and previous cholecystectomy . when women are considered separately , however , eight cases and no controls had undergone cholecystectomy ( odds ratio infinity lower 95 % confidence limits 1.7 , p greater than 0.01 ) . no association between previous cholecystectomy and large bowel adenomas was found in men . four of nine ( 44.4 % ) women with right sided colonic adenomas had undergone previous cholecystectomy compared with only three of 23 ( 13 % ) women with left sided adenomas . 
tumours and pseudotumours of the region of the ampulla of vater : an endoscopic , clinical and pathological study . from a large series of patients referred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to one endoscopist , 49 patients had the duodenoscopic appearance of a periampullary tumour . thirty eight of these lesions were neoplastic , but the remaining 11 patients had inflammatory non-neoplastic lesions ( pseudotumours ) . these could not be distinguished from the neoplasms on endoscopic appearances . the cholangiopancreatograms were similar except that the diameter of the pancreatic duct tended to be higher in the tumour group and gall stones were present significantly more often in the patients with pseudotumour . endoscopic biopsy correctly diagnosed 28 of 34 ampullary carcinomas . two of the 11 pseudotumour patients were subjected to surgical excision biopsy because of suspicious histological features of endoscopic biopsy . in the neoplastic group 19 patients underwent whipple 's procedure , seven surgical bypass , seven endoscopic sphincterotomy only and five died without successful biliary drainage . the overall one year survival was 44.7 % . by contrast , the patients with pseudotumours were clinically well at a median follow up 24 months ( range 12-41 months ) , after endoscopic sphincterotomy except for one 89 year old patient who died 22 months later from unrelated causes . 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and endoscopic papillotomy in patients with a previous billroth-ii resection . methods for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography ( erc ) and endoscopic papillotomy ( ept ) in patients with billroth-ii operations are described , and experience with their use during the last four years ( since 1980 ) is presented . endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successful in 134 of 147 patients ( 92 % ) and endoscopic papillotomy was successful in 46 of 50 patients . the described methods were used in two different hospitals by two different endoscopists and there was no difference in the results . we conclude that patients with a billroth-ii operation may undergo endoscopic diagnostic as well as therapeutic procedures with a high rate of success , with similar results as in ordinary patients and with no greater risk of complications . 
portal hypertensive gastric mucosa : an endoscopic study . the endoscopic features of the gastric mucosa in patients with cirrhosis have not been systematically investigated . in these patients , we observed an endoscopic aspect , consisting of multiple small erythematous areas , outlined by a subtle yellowish network ( resembling a mosaic ) , mainly located in the proximal part of the stomach . we tested the value of this sign by comparing two groups : 100 patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis , and 300 control patients without signs of liver disease or portal hypertension . this endoscopic pattern was observed in 94 of the patients with cirrhosis , whereas oesophageal varices were seen in 78 only . in contrast , only one patient of the control group had this aspect . moreover , this sign was also found in seven of eight patients with non cirrhotic portal hypertension , but was seen neither in 100 patients with chronic alcoholism but without liver disease , nor in 10 cirrhotic patients with end-to-side portacaval shunts . these endoscopic changes might be because of mucosal and / or submucosal oedema and congestion highlighting the normal areae gastricae pattern and related to raised portal pressure . we conclude that the mosaic pattern of the gastric mucosa is a sensible and specific sign for diagnosis of portal hypertension , whatever the cause . 
influence of the degree of liver failure on systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics and on response to propranolol in patients with cirrhosis . systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics were studied in patients with cirrhosis who had been classified in three groups ( a , b , and c ) according to the degree of liver failure ( modified pugh 's classification ) . in patients of group a , cardiac index was significantly lower than that of group c and systemic vascular resistance was higher , but not significantly so , than that of patients with liver failure . wedged hepatic venous pressure was significantly lower in the former group than in the latter . in patients in group b , corresponding values fell between those of groups a and c . azygos blood flow averaged 0.477 + / - 0.242 l / min ( mean + / - sd ) in group a and it was significantly lower than in groups b and c ( 0.642 + / - 0.224 and 1.061 + / - 0.476 l / min , respectively ) . in the three groups , acute administration of propranolol induced statistically significant changes in systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics . in patients of group c but not of group b , the mean value of azygos blood flow after propranolol remained significantly higher than in group a . moreover , the fraction of azygos blood flow to cardiac output decreased in groups a and b while slightly increased in group c . this study shows that in patients with cirrhosis , the degree of liver failure may be a determinant for the haemodynamic responses to drugs acting on portal hypertension . 
effects of cimetidine on the healing and recurrence of duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers . the effects of cimetidine on the healing and recurrence of duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers were compared . the extent of the acid secreting areas was examined by the endoscopic congo red methylene blue test . using the extent of acid secreting areas gastric ulcers were classified into ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas . duodenal ulcers were all associated with extensive acid secreting areas . the gastric acid outputs in the basal state and after maximal stimulation with gastrin were highest in duodenal ulcers , and lowest in gastric ulcers without extensive acid secreting areas . cimetidine treatment significantly promoted the healing of duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers with extensive acid secreting areas when compared with placebo , but not of the gastric ulcers without extensive acid secreting areas . cimetidine also significantly diminished the recurrence of duodenal ulcers , but not gastric ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas . these findings indicate that in japan cimetidine promotes the healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers associated with high gastric acid production and prevents recurrence of duodenal ulcers , but has little or no influence on the healing and recurrence of gastric ulcers associated with low acid secretion . 
eosinophilic gastroenteritis presenting in an adolescent with isolated colonic involvement . eosinophilic gastroenteritis most commonly involves the stomach and proximal small intestine with eosinophilic inflammation of either the mucosa , submucosa or serosa . the patient reported here had isolated eosinophilic colitis . the initial presentation with iron deficiency anaemia owing to occult gastrointestinal blood loss emphasises the need to evaluate the entire gastrointestinal tract in patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis . 
expectant management of patients with unilateral hepatic duct stricture and liver atrophy . three patients with postcholecystectomy unilateral hepatic duct stricture and subsequent liver atrophy were treated conservatively , with a successful outcome of up to three years follow up . a better understanding of the pathophysiological sequelae of segmental hepatic duct obstruction suggests that in such circumstances reconstructive surgery , with its attendant risks , may not invariably be necessary .

the occurrence of fever during hemodialysis and hemofiltration . a comparative study . the occurrence of fever during various blood purification methods was evaluated in a retrospective study . it could be demonstrated , that patients treated chronically by conventional hemodialysis experience six times more febrile episodes than patients on chronic hemofiltration ( 4.84 % versus 0.81 % ) . since many of the increased temperatures could not be explained by conventional means , it has to be assumed that the treatment itself caused the fever , possibly activating the monocyte hormone interleukin 1. it is of further note that there was no difference in the magnitude of the temperature due to septicaemia or to no obvious cause . this finding necessitates in our opinion an early antibiotic therapy in those cases where fever develops without clear explanation .

continuous arterio-venous ultrafiltration in cirrhotic patients with ascites or renal failure . to assess whether continuous arteriovenous ultrafiltration ( cavu ) might constitute a useful alternative to hemodialysis in the management of patients with advanced liver failure , we carried out cavu in 3 patients with decompensated laennec 's cirrhosis . cavu was utilized in two patients with acute renal failure and pulmonary edema to stabilize renal function and facilitate administration of large amounts of fluid . in the third case , cavu was successfully utilized to mobilize fluid in a patient refractory to conventional diuretic regimens . we conclude that cavu may constitute an appropriate alternative to traditional hemodialysis in patients with advanced liver disease and renal functional impairment . 
mineral metabolism during a hemofiltration session in children . we studied the effects of one session of hemofiltration on the mineral metabolism in a group of uremic children . we observed an increase of calcemia , accompanied by positive calcium balance , and a decrease of plasma phosphate and pth-mm . no substantial loss of plasma 25-oh d was found . it is concluded that hemofiltration has a positive effect on calcemia and is very effective in removing phosphate , but it acts only temporarily on pth removal . an adequate calcium concentration must be provided in the substitution fluid .

blood detoxification and other therapeutical alternatives in nephrology . the author summarizes a number of blood detoxification procedures with emphasis on hemoperfusion , hemodialysis and chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis . 
hemoperfusion based on artificial cells for aluminium and iron removal , immunosorption , fulminant hepatic failure , uremia , poisoning and metabolic assists . the author reviewed artificial cells and their applications in hemoperfusion for chronic renal failure , poisoning , fulminant hepatic failure , removal of aluminium and iron , and metabolic assists . other areas reviewed included artificial cells containing enzymes , multienzymes , immunosorbents , cell cultures and other areas . artificial cells can be formed as membrane coated adsorbent or microencapsulated adsorbent , enzymes and cells . the large surface to volume relationship and the ultrathin membrane of artificial cells allows the rapid equilibration of metabolites . artificial cells containing enzymes , ion exchange resin and activated charcoal have been used for hemoperfusion . the microencapsulated or membrane coated absorbents , enzymes , cells , immunosorbents and other material are prevented from releasing unwanted material into the circulation and prevented from adverse effects on blood cells . because of the problem of charcoal in releasing emboli and depleting platelets we first developed coated activated charcoal hemoperfusion for clinical application . this has been used extensively in clinical studies . the artificial cell approach has also been applied to a number of other hemoperfusion approaches . the lack of space only allows this paper to summarize some of the approaches originated from this research centre . 
technical aspects of hemoperfusion . a review of the different types of adsorbents being used in hemoperfusion . the different types of polymers used in coating charcoal are also reviewed . 
preclinical evaluation of haemosorbents . the selection of assessment procedures for the preclinical evaluation of haemosorbents and the relationship between such procedures and the intended application are exemplified by examination of the design and utilization of procedures based on the rat . procedures are described for haemoperfusion and for membrane plasma separation followed by on-line sorbent treatment of plasma ( plasma perfusion ) . these procedures are suitable for single or repeated use , with the animal in an unrestrained and conscious state . the relevance to the intended application is demonstrated with respect to artificial liver support by the ability of rat extracorporeal circuits to provide information on the relationship between sorbent properties and liver regeneration as determined by the proliferative response following partial hepatectomy . 
hemoperfusion in reduced-time programmes for chronic uremia . long-term results . this paper reports the authors ' 8 year experience in the clinical use of charcoal hemoperfusion as a means to reduce the weekly time of treatment in chronic uremic patients . two different programmes were applied . programme a ( 34 patients ) which involved substituting the 3 procedures per week of standard dialysis ( 4 hours duration each ) by 2 procedures of combined hemodialysis and hemoperfusion , again of 4 hours duration each . programme b ( 18 patients ) which involved substituting the 3 procedures per week of 4 hours duration by 3 procedures of 3 hours each , 2 of combined hemodialysis and hemoperfusion , 1 of conventional dialysis . the net weekly reduction was 33 % for programme a and 25 % for programme b . the efficacy of the two programmes was evaluated by clinical , hematochemical , nutritional and instrumental parameters . 
routine clinical applications of hemodialysis-hemoperfusion in chronic renal failure : case reports . five hemodialysis patients were treated with combined hemodialysis-hemoperfusion with their conventional hemodialyzer plus a 70-gram ultrathin collodion coated activated charcoal device for a total of 63 months . indications for this therapy included pericarditis , peripheral neuropathy , clotting of conventional hemodialyzers and reduction of dialysis time and frequency . the outcome was beneficial in all cases and stable biochemical and hematological parameters were maintained . no increase in heparin requirements was noted and the therapy was thought to be cost-effective . 
combined hemoperfusion / hemodialysis in the treatment of uremic patients with vascular access problems : case reports . 
kinetic modeling of powder charcoal haemoperfusion . the aim of this study was to achieve more understanding of the mass transfer characteristics of the filmadsorber haemoperfusion device . first , a structural model with mathematical description of the different diffusion steps was developed . exact quantification appeared very difficult , resulting in insufficient fit of predicted and measured concentration curves . moreover , the mathematics turned out simple , since the concentration courses could be described with one exponential power . therefore , a formal model was developed , assuming linear isotherms and adsorption , proportional to the average concentration in the column . with this model predicted in-vitro inlet and outlet concentrations could be fitted to the measured data accurately . a relation between both models is given under the condition of high intraparticle mass transfer , which is allowed in case of powder adsorbents . it can be concluded that structural models do not yield predictive tools for optimization of device geometry . a formal model with two constants determining device performance enables device optimization with the help of some in-vitro experiments . 
resin hemoperfusion for drug intoxication--an update . hemoperfusion through amberlite xad-4 resin column has been shown to effectively remove sedative-hypnotics , analgesics and other drugs causing acute intoxication . there is no appreciable clinical toxicity and dramatic shortening of coma time and possible decrease in mortality may be achieved . thrombocytopenia and clotting may be diminished by pre-perfusion coating with 2.5 % albumin . albumin coating may facilitate the repeated use of hemoperfusion without any complications . more recently , resin hemoperfusion has been used for procainamide , n-acetylprocainamide and theophylline intoxication achieving exceptionally high clearance rates . 
removal of unconjugated bilirubin by macroreticular resin in hemoperfusion . macroporous polystyrene and polyvinylpyridine beads with quaternary ammonium and tertiary groups were tailor-made for the adsorption of unconjugated bilirubin . in vitro studies in order to obtain high adsorption capacity , the synthesized macroporous resin should have an average pore size of about 160 a and with surface area as large as possible . as the crosslinking of the resin increased from 4 % -40 % the amount of bilirubin adsorbed increased from 0.17 mg / g to 2.0 mg / g . resins containing strong basic groups have higher adsorption capacities than their corresponding weak base groups . adsorption mechanism studies showed that both chemical and physical adsorption took place . adsorption of bilirubin in plasma was some what lower than in buffer solution . 
investigation of bilirubin removal by nk-110 resin hemoperfusion in jaundiced dogs . a jaundiced dog model was made by common bile duct-inferior vena cava shunt with a silicon rubber tube . blood bilirubin levels increased from 0.25 + / - 0.16 ( sd ) mg % to 15 + / - 1.4 ( sd ) mg % . these dog models were treated with a column containing 200 gm of macroreticular resin nk-110 which was linked between the femoral artery and vein . the rate of blood flow through the column was 200 ml / min . it was shown that total bilirubin reduced from 15 + / - 1.4 ( sd ) to 7.4 + / - 0.61 ( sd ) , conjugated bilirubin decreased from 6.97 + / - 0.63 to 3.5 + / - 0.33 ( sd ) and unconjugated bilirubin from 7.8 + / - 2.1 to 4.2 + / - 0.4 ( sd ) . there were no significant changes in protein , electrolyte , blood gases and acid base balance . results show that nk-110 resin has good blood-compatible and adsorption properties . 
bioartificial liver : implanted artificial cells microencapsulated living hepatocytes increases survival of liver failure rats . suspension of living hepatocytes were microencapsulated inside 300 micron mean diameter alginate artificial cells . the galactosamine fulminant hepatic failure rat model was used . 48 hours after the injection of galactosamine , grade ii coma hepatic failure rats were divided into pairs . one of the pair was randomly chosen for the control group , and the other for the treated group . each rat in the control group received one peritoneal injection of microcapsules containing no hepatocytes . each rat in the treated group received one peritoneal injection of microcapsules containing hepatocytes . the survival of the treated group is significantly higher than the control group . 
removal of denatured proteins with artificial reticulo-endothelial system ( ares ) . basic research has revealed that hydrophobic residues increased on the molecular surface of the denatured igg and that the denatured proteins in the plasma can be removed by several sorbents of different amino acids bonded from polyvinylalcohol hydroxide residue with a covalent bond . thus , an artificial reticulo-endothelial system was developed to supplement the human reticulo-endothelial system ( res ) by removing denatured proteins from the patient 's plasma . clinically , angiitis and raynaud 's phenomenon associated with collagen disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus were remarkably reduced following a series of ares treatments . the proteins adsorbed on the ares were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis . virtually no albumin was detected , and igg ( constant isoelectric point ) , igm , iga , iga dimer , c3 , c4 , fibrinogen and other unidentified spots were found in the elute from the ares column . 
adsorption of lipoprotein containing apolipoprotein-b through plasma separation for treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia . for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia , liposorber la-40 was clinically applied . the liposorber is a commercially developed affinity adsorbent for plasma perfusion which selectivity adsorbs low density lipoproteins and very low density lipoproteins and is specially designed for plasmapheretic treatment of hypercholesterolemia . the liposorber column , containing activated cellulose beads having an affinity for lipoprotein containing apolipoprotein-b , has an excellent adsorption capacity , excellent selectivity , minimum albumin loss . this new apheresis system was applied to 2 clinical cases . after seven months of trial perfusion every 2 weeks , patient condition was good , with a level of total cholesterol under 300 mg / dl . no replacement fluids were given during or after treatment . in this paper , clinical results of these patients were shown and the mechanism of adsorption of this specific adsorbent was discussed . 
blood detoxification by membrane plasma filtration . the recognition of macromolecule abnormalities in various metabolic or immunologic related disease states has led to the use of plasma exchange for therapeutics . limitations of plasma exchange , however , exist . membrane plasma filtration provides a practical alternative . solute removal can be made selective by the choice of operating conditions as temperature and the selection of the membrane / module design . the optimal temperature range is a function of the plasma type , solute concentrations and membrane system . operation at below physiologic temperature ( cryofiltration ) is particularly suited for the removal of cold aggregative solutes , while operation at near or above physiologic temperature is more suited for the separation of solutes having large size differences at normal physiologic temperature . membrane filtration is simple and safe to perform , is more selective than plasma exchange , does not require plasma product infusion and is more versatile than selective sorption in its applications . 
selective removal of pathogenetic macromolecules directly from whole blood by double filtration technique . double filtration plasmapheresis ( dfpp ) is a technique devised in an attempt to selectively remove pathogenetic macromolecules such as antibodies , immune complexes or viscosity-increasing substances directly from blood . in order to realize the differential filtration principle , two filters , one for separation of plasma and another for fractionation of plasma components , are installed in an extracorporeal circulation line . selective separation of the plasma components is dependent on the filtration property of the two filters . clinical experiences evidence the usefulness of this technique in regard to conservation of human blood products for supplementation .

vertical gradient of pulmonary capillary transit times . the key determinants of alveolar capillary perfusion are transit times and the extent of recruitment . capillaries are known to be heavily recruited in the dependent lung , but there are no direct data that bear on how capillary transit times might be affected by gravity . we directly determined mean capillary transit times on the surface of the upper , middle , and lower lung by measuring the passage of fluorescent dye through the capillaries using in vivo television microscopy . in anesthetized dogs , mean capillary transit times averaged 12.3 s in the upper lung , 3.1 s in the midlung , and 1.6 s in the lower lung . this near order of magnitude variation in speed of blood transit establishes that there is a vertical gradient of capillary transit times in the lung . as expected , dependent capillary networks were nearly fully recruited , whereas relatively few capillaries were perfused in the upper lung . the lengthy transit times and sparsely perfused capillary beds in the upper lung combine to provide a substantial part of pulmonary gas exchange reserve . 
occlusion pressure and ventilation during sleep in normal humans . previous investigation in normal humans has demonstrated reduced ventilation and ventilatory responses to chemical stimuli during sleep . most have interpreted this to be a product of decreasing central nervous system sensitivity to the normal stimuli that maintain ventilation , whereas other factors such as increasing airflow resistance could also contribute to this reduction in respiration . to improve our understanding of these events , we measured ventilation and occlusion pressures ( p0.1 ) during unstimulated ventilation and rebreathing-induced hypercapnia during wakefulness and non-rapid-eye-movement ( nrem ) and rapid-eye-movement ( rem ) sleep . eighteen subjects ( 10 males and 8 females ) of whom seven were snorers ( 5 males and 2 females ) were studied . ventilation was reduced during both nrem and rem sleep ( p less than 0.05 ) , but this decrement in minute ventilation tended to be greater in snorers than nonsnorers . unstimulated p0.1 , on the other hand , was maintained or increased during sleep in all groups studied , with males and snorers showing the largest increase . the hypercapnic ventilatory response fell during both nrem and rem sleep and tended to be lower during rem than nrem sleep . however , the p0.1 response to hypercapnia during nrem sleep was well maintained at the waking level although the rem response was statistically reduced . these studies suggest that the mechanism of the reduction in ventilation and the hypercapnic ventilatory response seen during sleep , particularly nrem sleep , is likely to be multifactorial and not totally a product of decreasing central respiratory drive . 
control of activity of the diaphragm in rapid-eye-movement sleep . respiration in rapid-eye-movement sleep ( rems ) is known to be highly variable . the purpose of this study was to investigate the source of this variability and to determine which ordering principles remained operative in rem sleep . in unrestrained , naturally sleeping cats we recorded the electroencephalogram , electrooculogram , neck electromyogram , and diaphragmatic electromyogram ( emg ) and computed its moving average ( madi ) . as a reference , we first examined madi during " tonic " rems , since breathing is fairly regular in this state . " control " ranges for peak amplitude ( pemg ) , inspiratory time ( ti ) , duration of postinspiratory inspiratory activity , expiratory time , and the calculated inspiratory slope ( pemg / ti ) were determined by overlaying individual breath traces of the time course of madi during tonic rems to form a composite tracing . next , the time course of the emg during individual breaths in slow-wave sleep ( sws ) and a complete period of consecutive breaths in rems ( both tonic and phasic ) were compared with this tonic rems composite . the number of eye movements per breath was tabulated as an index of phasic activity . the inspiratory slopes during sws and tonic rems were similar . however , during phasic rems , many breaths displayed either increases ( excitation ) or decreases ( inhibition ) in slope compared with the " typical " breaths seen in tonic rems . the occurrence of these altered slopes increased with the frequency of phasic events . ti was inversely related to the slope of the emg , which tended to minimize changes in pemg .

enhanced lipolysis is not evident in adipocytes from exercise-trained shr . adipocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats ( shr ) are not as responsive to isoproterenol or dibutyryl adenosine 3 ' , 5'-cyclic monophosphate ( camp ) stimulation compared with sprague-dawley or wistar-kyoto rats . lipolytic activity in adipocytes from trained normotensive rats was enhanced in response to 1 microm isoproterenol and 0.5 mm dibutyryl camp but not in adipocytes from trained shr . decreases in isoproterenol-stimulated ( 1 microm ) camp accumulation were evident in adipocytes from trained normotensive rats but not in adipocytes from trained shr . basal and agonist-induced lipolysis in fat cells isolated from both normotensive rats and shr immediately following a 60-min run was increased in both sedentary and trained rats . adenylate cyclase activity in fat cell membranes was blunted in sedentary and trained shr both in the absence and presence of 100 microm 5'-guanylyl imidophosphate . no apparent differences existed in antagonist affinity of binding sites for the antagonist dihydroalprenolol in normal rats or shr . evidence for a change in affinity of agonist isoproterenol might be indicated based on the enhanced potency of isoproterenol to stimulate lipolysis in trained normal rats . beta-adrenergic receptor density and antagonist affinity were not different in normotensive rats and shr in response to training . however , displacement of [ 3h ] dihydroalprenolol in adipocytes from shr required greater concentrations of isoproterenol compared with adipocytes from normotensive rats , further suggestive of increased agonist affinity of binding sites in normal rats . these data suggest a postreceptor lesion of the lipolytic pathway in adipocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats , possibly at the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein level .

within-breath electromyographic changes during loaded breathing in adult sheep . to investigate the changes in diaphragm electromyogram ( emg ) during the course of severe loaded breathing , we subjected five conscious adult sheep to inspiratory flow resistive breathing ( resistance greater than 150 cmh2o x l-1 x s ) for up to 2-3 h and studied the total emg power per breath ( iemg ) and the emg power per unit time after dividing the duration of emg activity within each breath into three equal parts ( iemg1 , iemg2 , and iemg3 ) . both total breath iemg and transdiaphragmatic pressure ( pdi ) increased , remained at a high level for a certain period of time , and then started to fall . a change in the pattern of iemg within a breath was observed during loaded breathing . the increase in total-breath iemg was associated mostly with an increase in iemg3 , or the last part of the emg power within each inspiration . similarly , the decrease in total breath iemg was primarily due to a decrease in iemg3 . we conclude that , in sheep subjected to severe ifr loads for prolonged periods the marked increase in total-breath iemg at the beginning of loaded breathing and the marked decrease in this iemg at the time of decrease in pdi are largely due to changes in iemg that occur during the latter third of each breath . we speculate that during loaded breathing the recruitment pattern of diaphragmatic muscle fibers changes during the course of an inspiratory effort . 
vip and phm and their role in nonadrenergic inhibitory responses in isolated human airways . there is increasing evidence in many species that vasoactive intestinal peptide ( vip ) may be a neurotransmitter in nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves . we have studied the effect of electrical field stimulation ( efs ) , exogenous vip , and isoproterenol ( iso ) on human airways in vitro . we have also studied a related peptide , peptide histidine methionine ( phm ) , which coexists with vip in human airway nerves , and in separate experiments studied fragments of the vip amino acid sequence ( vip1-10 and vip16-28 ) for agonist and antagonist activity . human airways were obtained at thoracotomy and studied in an organ bath . in bronchi efs gave an inhibitory response that was unaltered by 10 ( -6 ) m propranolol but was blocked by tetrodotoxin , whereas in bronchioles there was little or no nonadrenergic inhibitory response . vip , phm , and iso all caused dose-dependent relaxation of bronchi , vip and phm being approximately 50-fold more potent than iso . vip , but not iso , mimicked the time course of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve stimulation . in contrast bronchioles relaxed to iso but not to vip or phm . neither propranolol nor indomethacin altered the relaxant effects of vip or phm , suggesting a direct effect of these peptides on airway smooth muscle . neither of the vip fragments showed either agonist or antagonist activity . we conclude that vip and phm are more potent bronchodilators of human bronchi than iso and that the association between the relaxant effects of these peptides and nonadrenergic inhibitory responses suggests that they may be possible neurotransmitters of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves in human airways . 
respiratory adaptation to chronic hypoxia in newborn rats . newborn rats were maintained in an hypoxic chamber ( 10 % o2 in n2 ) from the day of birth up to 2 wk of postnatal life . body weight ( bw ) and nose-tail length were less in the hypoxic exposed ( h ) rats than in control ( c ) animals growing in air . hematocrit rose from about 37 % to about 51 % . oxygen consumption ( vo2 ) , measured with a manometric method , was lower in h than in c rats ; the difference remained at 5-7 days even after normalization by bw . at 5-7 days ventilation , measured with an airflow plethysmograph , was much more elevated in h rats ( whether breathing 10 % o2 or air ) than in c rats , with an increase in both tidal volume and frequency . this indicates that the biphasic ventilatory response , characterized by an initial rise and then a fall of ventilation toward normoxic values , commonly observed in newborns during acute hypoxic challenge is an immediate but only transient response . the dry lung weight-to-bw ratio and alveolar size were larger in h than in c rats . lung volumes at 20 cmh2o were similar , despite the smaller bw of the h rats . hence , in the rat , chronic hypoxia in the immediate postnatal period increases o2-carrying capacity , decreases metabolic demands , increases alveolar o2 availability , and promotes structural changes in the lung that protect the gas exchange area and optimize the structure-function relationship of the lung . these results may also suggest that the lung structural alterations with chronic hypoxia should not be attributed to changes in vo2 but , eventually , to the ventilatory action of the organ . 
plasma adrenocorticotropin and cortisol responses to brief high-intensity exercise in humans . the purpose of this study is to examine plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropin ( acth ) levels following a brief high-intensity bout of exercise . each subject ( n = 6 ) performed a 1-min bout of exercise on a cycle ergometer at 120 % of his maximum o2 uptake . blood samples were collected at rest , immediately following the exercise bout , and at 5 , 15 , and 30 min postexercise . mean ( + / - se ) plasma acth levels increased significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) from 2.2 + / - 0.4 pmol / l at rest to 6.2 + / - 1.7 pmol / l immediately following exercise . mean ( + / - se ) plasma cortisol levels increased significantly from 0.40 + / - 0.04 mumol / l at rest to 0.52 + / - 0.04 mumol / l at 15 min postexercise . these data show that brief high-intensity exercise results in significant increases in plasma cortisol and acth levels . furthermore , the temporal sequence between the two hormones suggests that the increase in plasma cortisol levels following brief high-intensity exercise is the result of acth-induced steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex . 
stimulation of groups iii and iv phrenic afferents reflexly decreases total lung resistance in dogs . little is known about the reflex effect on airway caliber evoked by stimulation of phrenic afferents . therefore , in chloralose-anesthetized , paralyzed dogs , we recorded airflow , airway pressure , arterial pressure , and heart rate while electrically stimulating a phrenic nerve . total lung resistance was calculated breath by breath . the phrenic nerve was stimulated at 3 , 5 , 20 , 70 , 140 , and 200 times motor threshold and the compound action potential was recorded . stimulation of the phrenic nerve at three and five times threshold , which activated groups i , ii , and a few group iii fibers , had no effect on any of the variables measured . stimulation at 20 times threshold , which activated many group iii fibers and groups i and ii fibers , reflexly decreased resistance . stimulation at 70 , 140 , and 200 times threshold , which activated groups i-iv fibers , evoked progressively greater decreases in lung resistance . the reflex bronchodilation evoked by phrenic nerve stimulation was unaffected by propranolol or phentolamine but was abolished by atropine . we conclude that activation of groups iii and iv phrenic nerve afferents reflexly decreased total lung resistance by withdrawing cholinergic tone to airway smooth muscle . 
influence of central venous pressure change on plasma vasopressin in humans . after overnight food and fluid restriction , nine healthy males were examined before , during , and after lower body positive pressure ( lbpp ) of 11 + / - 1 mmhg ( mean + / - se ) for 30 min and before , during , and after graded lower body negative pressure ( lbnp ) of -10 + / - 1 , -20 + / - 2 , and -30 + / - 2 mmhg for 20 min each . lbpp and lbnp were performed with the subject in the supine position in a plastic box encasing the subject from the xiphoid process and down , thus including the splanchnic area . central venous pressure ( cvp ) during supine rest was 7.5 + / - 0.5 mmhg , increasing to 13.4 + / - 0.8 mmhg ( p less than 0.001 ) during lbpp and decreasing significantly at each step of lbnp to 2.0 + / - 0.5 mmhg ( p less than 0.001 ) at 15 min of -30 + / - 2 mmhg lbnp . plasma arginine vasopressin ( avp ) did not change significantly in face of this large variation in cvp of 11.4 mmhg . mean arterial pressure increased significantly during lbpp from 100 + / - 2 to 117 + / - 3 torr ( p less than 0.001 ) and only at one point during lbnp of -30 + / - 2 mmhg from 102 + / - 1 to 115 + / - 5 mmhg ( p less than 0.05 ) . heart rate did not change during lbpp but increased slightly from 51 + / - 3 to 55 + / - 3 beats / min ( p less than 0.05 ) only at 7 min of lbnp of -30 + / - 2 mmhg . plasma osmolality , sodium , and potassium did not change during the experiment . hemoglobin concentration increased during lbpp and lbnp , whereas hematocrit only increased during lbnp .

effect of long-term anemia and retransfusion on central circulation during exercise . the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term anemia and subsequent retransfusion of erythrocytes on various circulatory parameters . anemia was induced in nine healthy male subjects by repeated venesections . the stored blood was retransfused after 9 wk ( range 8-11 wk ) . exercise tests were performed before venesection in the control state ( c ) , in the anemic state ( a ) , and 48 h after retransfusion ( r ) . hemoglobin concentration levels were 146 + / - 10 g / l in c , 110 + / - 7 g / l in a , and 145 + / - 9 g / l in r . maximal o2 uptake was 4.55 + / - 0.6 , 3.74 + / - 0.7 , and 4.45 + / - 0.6 l / min in c , a , and r , respectively . a decrease in heart rate of 7 beats / min ( p less than 0.01 ) and in cardiac output of 2 l / min ( p less than 0.05 ) at maximal exercise occurred in the anemic state compared with control values . these decreases were not reversed but , rather , were further accentuated after retransfusion . the adaptive response to submaximal exercise ( cycling at 150-175 w ) in anemia was mediated to the amount of 50 % by an increase in cardiac output ( mainly an increase in heart rate ) and 50 % was due to increased o2 extraction in the peripheral tissue . in conclusion , long-term anemia was found to decrease the heart rate and cardiac output at maximal exercise . furthermore the close correlation between hemoglobin concentration and maximal o2 uptake in humans is confirmed . 
metabolic cost of walking : equation and model . twenty years of published experience with the workman-armstrong equation for predicting walking vo2 is reviewed . the equation is reexpressed in currently accepted terminology , and it is shown that the equation serves well as a basic model of normal walking . employing this model to analyze vo2 / step leads to the elaboration of a three-compartment model of the metabolic cost of walking . this three-compartment model provides a rational estimate of the fraction of walking 's metabolic cost that powers the actual walking movement . doubt is expressed that " comfortable speed of walking " is definable in energy terms . it is suggested that the requirements of maintaining balance while walking may determine both the comfortable speed of walking and the curvilinearity of the relationship between ground-speed and freely chosen step frequency of walking . 
characterization of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in cat tracheal gland cells . studies of airway glands indicate a muscarinic cholinergic regulation of secretion . because of the cellular complexity of the airways , receptor characterization in whole tissue is unfeasible . therefore , we utilized homogenates of disaggregated gland cells isolated from cat trachea and the muscarinic antagonist [ 1-3h ] quinuclidinyl benzilate ( [ 3h ] qnb ) to characterize glandular muscarinic receptors . receptors of isolated cells were functionally intact as assessed by carbachol ( 10 ( -4 ) m ) stimulation of o2 consumption 86 + / - 6 % ( + / - se , n = 20 ) . stimulation was dose dependent ( mean effective concentration = 3.5 microm ) , inhibited by atropine [ dissociation constant ( kd ) = 4.2 nm ] but not phentolamine nor propranolol . specific binding of [ 3h ] qnb to cell homogenates was saturable , of high affinity ( kd = 36 pm ) and to a single population of receptors . maximum binding was 58 fmol / 10 ( 6 ) cells or about 35 , 000 receptors per cell . estimated affinities for muscarinic agents were in the micromolar range for agonists and nanomolar range for antagonists . histamine , alpha-adrenergic , and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists did not inhibit specific binding . these results suggest that muscarinic receptors on tracheal gland cells are of high affinity and density . 
effect of perfusate hematocrit on urea permeability-surface area in isolated dog lung . seven dog lower left lung lobes were statically inflated and perfused at a constant rate for each lobe with a perfusate in which the hematocrit was altered over a wide range . the permeability-surface area of urea was calculated from multiple indicator dilution curves using two separate injectates for each hematocrit level . one injectate contained only 125i-albumin as the vascular reference tracer and the other contained both 51cr-erythrocytes and 125i-albumin as the vascular reference tracers ; both contained [ 14c ] urea as the permeating tracer . the results strongly indicate that the phenomenon of " erythrocyte trapping " of urea does not affect the calculation of urea permeability-surface area product provided the appropriate albumin-erythrocyte composite reference tracer is utilized in its calculation . 
nonuniformity of canine lung washout by high-frequency ventilation . ethane washout during low tidal volume ( 25-100 ml ) high-frequency ( 3-40 hz ) ventilation ( hfv ) was studied in seven excised dog lungs . the lungs were initially equilibrated with 1 % ethane , and then the concentration of ethane was monitored by mass spectrometry from multiple anatomic sites along the tracheobronchial tree during washout . we observed that the lung changed from a uniform distribution of ethane concentrations to a nonuniform distribution by a three-phase process . the first phase was nearly complete within the first 15 s and probably corresponds to concentration gradients being established in the central airways . during the second phase of washout , which lasted for several minutes , the concentrations in the various alveolar regions diverged . in the final phase , the regional concentrations remained at fixed ratios , and washout from all sites in the lung was at a constant fractional rate . these data are consistent with a model in which the duration of the second phase and the magnitude of the regional concentration differences established in this phase are dependent on both the magnitude of differences between regional transport paths and the nature of regional coupling by a common transport path to the airway opening . 
variable site of airway narrowing among obstructive sleep apnea patients . the purpose of this was to determine whether the site of physiological narrowing within the upper airway was uniform or differed among patients with obstructive sleep apnea . inspiratory pressures were measured with an esophageal balloon catheter and three catheters located at different sites along the upper airway : supralaryngeal airway , oropharynx , and nasopharynx . peak inspiratory pressure differences between catheters allowed assessment of pressure gradients across three airway segments : lungs-larynx-retroepiglottal airway ( esophageal-supralaryngeal pressure ) , hypopharynx ( supralaryngeal-oropharynx pressure ) , and transpalatal airway ( oropharynx-nasopharynx pressure ) . in five patients , hypopharyngeal obstruction was present , and in four patients no hypopharyngeal obstruction existed . in these four patients the site of obstruction was located at the level of the palate . in a given subject , the site of obstruction was the same during repeated measurements . the presence or absence of hypopharyngeal narrowing during sleep was not predictable from gradients measured across different segments of the upper airway during wakefulness . we conclude that the site of physiological upper airway obstruction varies among patients with obstructive sleep apnea and is not predictable from pressure measured during wakefulness . we speculate that uvulopalatopharyngoplasty may not relieve obstructive apneas in patients with hypopharyngeal obstruction . 
effect of hydration on plasma volume and endocrine responses to water immersion . to determine the effect of hydration on the early osmotic and intravascular volume and endocrine responses to water immersion the hematocrit , hemoglobin , plasma renin activity ( pra ) , and plasma electrolyte , aldosterone ( pa ) , and vasopressin ( pvp ) concentrations were measured during immersion following 24-h dehydration ; these were compared with corresponding values following rapid rehydration . six men and one woman ( age 23-46 yr ) underwent 45 min of standing immersion to the neck preceded by 45-min standing without immersion , first dehydrated , and then 105 min later after rehydration with water . immersion caused an isotonic expansion of the plasma volume ( p less than 0.001 ) , which occurred independently of hydration status . suppression of pra ( p less than 0.001 ) and pa ( p less than 0.001 ) during both immersions also occurred independently of hydration status . suppression of plasma vasopressin was observed during dehydrated immersion ( p less than 0.001 ) but not during rehydrated immersion . it is concluded that plasma tonicity is not a factor influencing pvp suppression during water immersion . 
induction of periodic breathing during sleep causes upper airway obstruction in humans . to test the hypothesis that occlusive apneas result from sleep-induced periodic breathing in association with some degree of upper airway compromise , periodic breathing was induced during non-rapid-eye-movement ( nrem ) sleep by administering hypoxic gas mixtures with and without applied external inspiratory resistance ( 9 cmh2o x l-1 x s ) in five normal male volunteers . in addition to standard polysomnography for sleep staging and respiratory pattern monitoring , esophageal pressure , tidal volume ( vt ) , and airflow were measured via an esophageal catheter and pneumotachograph , respectively , with the latter attached to a tight-fitting face mask , allowing calculation of total pulmonary system resistance ( rp ) . during stage i / ii nrem sleep minimal period breathing was evident in two of the subjects ; however , in four subjects during hypoxia and / or relief from hypoxia , with and without added resistance , pronounced periodic breathing developed with waxing and waning of vt , sometimes with apneic phases . resistive loading without hypoxia did not cause periodicity . at the nadir of periodic changes in vt , rp was usually at its highest and there was a significant linear relationship between rp and 1 / vt , indicating the development of obstructive hypopneas . in one subject without added resistance and in the same subject and in another during resistive loading , upper airway obstruction at the nadir of the periodic fluctuations in vt was observed . we conclude that periodic breathing resulting in periodic diminution of upper airway muscle activity is associated with increased upper airway resistance that predisposes upper airways to collapse . 
respiratory timing during nrem sleep in patients with occlusive sleep apnea . to study respiratory timing mechanisms in patients with occlusive apnea , inspiratory and expiratory times ( ti and te ) were calculated from the diaphragmatic electromyogram obtained in seven patients during non-rapid-eye-movement ( nrem ) sleep . peak diaphragmatic activity ( emgdi ) had a curvilinear relationship with ti during the ventilatory and occlusive phases such that ti shortened as emgdi decreased during the ventilatory phase ( r = 0.87 , p less than 0.05 ) and it prolonged as emgdi increased during the occlusive phase ( r = 0.89 , p less than 0.02 ) . however , emgdi vs . ti for the occlusive phase was shifted to the right of that for the ventilatory phase , reflecting the relatively longer ti during upper airway occlusion . ti also had a linear relationship with pleural pressure ( r = 0.94 , p less than 0.001 ) that remained unchanged during the ventilatory and occlusive phases such that it prolonged as negative inspiratory pressure increased . these results indicate that respiratory timing is continuously modified in patients with occlusive apnea as inspiratory neural drive fluctuates during nrem sleep and suggest that this modification is due to the net effects of changing inspiratory neural drive and afferent input predominantly from upper airway mechanoreceptors . 
epithelial modulation of tracheal smooth muscle response to antigenic stimulation . the role of the epithelium has been studied in the contractile responses of rat trachea . the different modulations observed are discussed in respect to vagal components of the epithelial layer . responses of rat trachea to immunologic stimulation are shown to be dependent on the presence of the epithelium , which prolongs the relaxation stage without affecting the contractions . this prolongation is abolished by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment , whereas substance p induces a significantly greater relaxation of serotonin-precontracted intact than deepithelialized trachea . serotonin concentration-response curves are shifted to the right in intact preparations , which is partly reversed by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment , but a hyporeactivity of the tissue exists . a relaxing factor released by the epithelium is hypothesized , possibly dependent on substance p-ergic innervation . muscarinic cholinergic innervation slightly modulates the contractions but not the relaxations in antigen-induced responses , independently on the presence of the epithelial layer . 4-aminopyridine induces epithelium-dependent potentiations of contractions to antigen and to serotonin , which involves acetylcholine at one step of the reaction cascade . epithelial-dependent contracting and relaxing factors are thus suggested in rat trachea . 
carbohydrate metabolism in fructose-fed and food-restricted running rats . in chronically catheterized rats hepatic glycogen was increased by fructose ( approximately 10 g / kg ) gavage ( ff rats ) or lowered by overnight food restriction ( fr rats ) . [ 3-3h ] - and [ u-14c ] glucose were infused before , during , and after treadmill running . during exercise the increase in glucose production ( ra ) was always directly related to work intensity and faster than the increase in glucose disappearance , resulting in increased plasma glucose levels . at identical work-loads the increase in ra and plasma glucose as well as liver glycogen breakdown were higher in ff and control ( c ) rats than in fr rats . breakdown of muscle glycogen was less in ff than in c rats . incorporation of [ 14c ] glucose in glycogen at rest and mobilization of label during exercise partly explained that 14c estimates of carbohydrate metabolism disagreed with chemical measurements . in some muscles glycogen depletion was not accompanied by loss of 14c and 3h , indicating futile cycling of glucose . in fr rats a postexercise increase in liver glycogen was seen with 14c / 3h similar to that of plasma glucose , indicating direct synthesis from glucose . in conclusion , in exercising rats the increase in glucose production is subjected to feedforward regulation and depends on the liver glycogen concentration . endogenous glucose may be incorporated in glycogen in working muscle and may be used directly for liver glycogen synthesis rather than after conversion to trioses . fructose ingestion may diminish muscular glycogen breakdown . the [ 14c ] glucose infusion technique for determination of muscular glycogenolysis is of doubtful value in rats . 
immunologic and nonimmunologic responsiveness in ragweed-sensitized dogs . the relationship between airway responsiveness to inhaled antigen and histamine , immunologic release of lung histamine , immunologic responsiveness of skin , and specific immunoglobulin e ( ige ) antibodies were examined in 11 inbred allergic dogs immunized with extracts of ragweed and grass and 5 nonimmunized control dogs from the same colony . airway responsiveness to antigen and histamine was characterized by the doses that increased the airflow resistance of the total respiratory system to twice the control values ( ed200 ) . highly significant correlations were found between airway responsiveness and cutaneous responsiveness to antigen and other immunologic characteristics ( e.g. , ige and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen ) in all dogs . in ragweed-sensitized dogs , there was an inverse correlation between immunologic responsiveness ( reflected by the cutaneous response to antigen and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen ) and nonimmunologic responsiveness of airways ( histamine ed200 : r = 0.73 , p less than 0.05 and r = 0.75 , p less than 0.01 , respectively ) . antigen ed200 was also correlated with histamine release from lung after antigen inhalation ( r = 0.74 ; p less than 0.01 ) . we conclude that airway reactions to inhaled antigen in allergic dogs are dependent not only on immunologic factors but also on the degree of nonimmunologic airway responsiveness to histamine and that these factors are correlated inversely . 
energetics of wet-suit diving in japanese male breath-hold divers . the present study was undertaken to investigate energy balance in professional male breath-hold divers in tsushima island , japan . in 4 divers , rectal ( tre ) and mean skin ( tsk ) temperatures and rate of o2 consumption ( vo2 ) were measured during diving work in summer ( 27 degrees c water ) and winter ( 14 degrees c water ) . thermal insulation and energy costs of diving work were estimated . in summer , comparisons were made of subjects clad either in wet suits ( protected ) or in swimming trunks ( unprotected ) , and in winter , they wore wet suits . the average tre in unprotected divers decreased to 36.4 + / - 0.2 degrees c at the end of 1-h diving work , but in protected divers it decreased to 37.2 + / - 0.3 degrees c in 2 h in summer and to 36.9 + / - 0.1 degree c in 1.5 h in winter . the average tsk of unprotected divers decreased to 28.0 + / - 0.6 degrees c in summer and that of protected divers decreased to 32.9 + / - 0.5 degrees c in summer and 28.0 + / - 0.3 degrees c in winter . average vo2 increased 190 % ( from 370 ml / min before diving to 1 , 070 ml / min ) in unprotected divers in summer , but in protected divers it rose 120 % ( from 360 to 780 ml / min ) in summer and 110 % ( from 330 to 690 ml / min ) in winter . overall thermal insulation ( tissue and wet suit ) calculated for protected divers was 0.065 + / - 0.006 degree c x kcal-1 x m-2 x h-1 in summer and 0.135 + / - 0.019 degree c x kcal-1 x m-2 x h-1 in winter .

estimation of response curves in closed-loop physiological control . several recent reports have addressed the problem of estimating the response slope from repeated measurements of paired data when both stimulus and response variables are subject to biological variability . these earlier approaches suffer from several drawbacks : useful information about the relationships between the error components in a closed-loop system is not fully utilized ; the response intercept cannot be directly estimated ; and the normalization procedure required in some methods may fail under certain circumstances . this paper proposes a new , general method of simultaneously estimating the response slope and intercept from corrupted stimulus-response data when the errors in both variables are specifically related by the system structure . a direct extension of the least-squares approach , this method [ directed least squares ( dls ) ] reduces to ordinary least-squares methods when either of the measured variables is error free and to the reduced-major-axis ( rma ) method of kermack and haldane ( biometrics 37 : 30-41 , 1950 ) when the magnitudes of the normalized errors are equal . the dls estimators are scale invariant , statistically unbiased and always assume the minimum variance . with simple modifications , the method is also applicable to paired data . if , however , the relation between error components is uncertain , then the rma method is optimal , i.e. , having the least possible asymptotic bias and variance . these results are illustrated by using various types of closed-loop respiratory response data . 
changes in cross-bridge properties of sensitized airway smooth muscle . we have reported previously that in ovalbumin-sensitized canine tracheal smooth muscle ( tsm ) the maximum ability to shorten is increased . this could account for the increased airway narrowing seen in vivo in allergic bronchoconstriction . it was associated with increased velocity of shortening . we now report that , by using an electromagnetic muscle lever system , quick releases were applied to control and sensitized tsm at 0.5-s intervals throughout the course of a lightly preloaded 10-s isotonic contraction . from the records obtained it is possible to determine that , early in contraction , shortening is brought about by relatively rapidly cycling [ 0.35 optimal muscle length units + / - 0.033 / s ( se ) ] cross bridges . we also report that in the sensitized tsm it is the early bridges that increase their velocity by 26.6 % ( p less than 0.05 ) compared with similar bridges in muscles from control animals . since 70 % of the maximum shortening of the muscle occurs when early bridges are operative , it is likely that these bridges are responsible for the major part of the shortening . it is thus probable that increased allergic bronchoconstriction is produced by increased activity of early , rapidly cycling bridges . the bridges that are active late in the shortening show no difference between control and sensitized airway smooth muscles . 
effects of electrode location on myoelectric conduction velocity and median frequency estimates . the effect of surface electrode location on the estimates of the median frequency and conduction velocity of the myoelectric signal was investigated . the locations were identified with respect to the innervation zone and the tendonous portion of the tibialis anterior muscle . considerable modifications in the median frequency and conduction velocity parameters were noted . the highest values of the median frequency occurred at the region of the innervation zone and tendonous insertion of the muscle , and decreased proportionally with distance from these areas . the rate of change of median frequency was not effected by electrode location . estimates of conduction velocity were most stable in a region between the distal tendon and the adjacent innervation zone . this region also provided the best linear fit when comparing conduction velocity to median frequency estimates . the implications for signal detection procedures are discussed . 
bath rewarming from immersion hypothermia [ published erratum appears in j appl physiol 1986 dec ; 61 ( 6 ) : following 2314 ] trunk-only bath rewarming has often been recommended over whole-body bath rewarming as a method for the treatment of immersion hypothermia . at present , no report of a direct comparison of the relative merits of these techniques has been made . authorities in favor of trunk-only bath rewarming base their proposal on the assumption that core temperature afterdrop would be minimized by preventing peripheral vasodilation when the subject 's limbs are not immersed in the rewarming bath . in the present study , trunk-only and whole-body bath rewarming are compared by rewarming eight mildly hypothermic male subjects twice , once via each technique . it was concluded that trunk-only rewarming is not superior to whole-body bath rewarming as a therapy for mild immersion hypothermia , based on the findings that no significant differences existed between the two techniques , either in size or duration of core temperature afterdrop , or in rate of rewarming . 
control of respiratory activity of the genioglossus muscle in micrognathic infants . the genioglossus ( gg ) muscle activity of four infants with micrognathia and obstructive sleep apnea was recorded to assess the role of this tongue muscle in upper airway maintenance . respiratory air flow , esophageal pressure , and intramuscular gg electromyograms ( emg ) were recorded during wakefulness and sleep . both tonic and phasic inspiratory gg-emg activity was recorded in each of the infants . on occasion , no phasic gg activity could be recorded ; these silent periods were unassociated with respiratory embarrassment . gg activity increased during sigh breaths . gg activity also increased when the infants spontaneously changed from oral to nasal breathing and , in two infants , with neck flexion associated with complete upper airway obstruction , suggesting that gg-emg activity is influenced by sudden changes in upper airway resistance . during sleep , the gg-emg activity significantly increased with 5 % co2 breathing ( p less than or equal to 0.001 ) . with nasal airway occlusion during sleep , the gg-emg activity increased with the first occluded breath and progressively increased during the subsequent occluded breaths , indicating mechanoreceptor and suggesting chemoreceptor modulation . during nasal occlusion trials , there was a progressive increase in phasic inspiratory activity of the gg-emg that was greater than that of the diaphragm activity ( as reflected by esophageal pressure excursions ) . when pharyngeal airway closure occurred during a nasal occlusion trial , the negative pressure at which the pharyngeal airway closed ( upper airway closing pressure ) correlated with the gg-emg activity at the time of closure , suggesting that the gg muscle contributes to maintaining pharyngeal airway patency in the micrognathic infant . 
nitrogen gas exchange in the human knee . human decompression sickness is presumed to result from excess inert gas in the body when ambient pressure is reduced . although the most common symptom is pain in the skeletal joints , no direct study of nitrogen exchange in this region has been undertaken . for this study , nitrogen tagged with radioactive 13n was prepared in a linear accelerator . nine human subjects rebreathed this gas from a closed circuit for 30 min , then completed a 40- to 100-min washout period breathing room air . the isotope 13n was monitored continuously in the subject 's knee during the entire period using positron detectors . after correction for isotope decay ( half-life = 9.96 min ) , the concentration in most knees continued to rise for at least 30 min into the washout period . various causes of this unexpected result are discussed , the most likely of which is an extensive redistribution of gas within avascular knee tissues . 
distribution of cyclic amp phosphodiesterase in adipose tissue from trained rats . fat cells were isolated from sedentary and exercise trained female sprague-dawley rats and cyclic amp phosphodiesterase ( cyclic amp-pde ) activities were determined from crude homogenates of the fat cells in the whole homogenate , p5 , p48 , and s48 fractions . exercise training resulted in a significant increase in the mean specific activity of cyclic amp-pde ( pmol x min-1 x mg-1 ) from the whole homogenate and s48 fraction at cyclic amp concentrations of 4 , 8 , and 16 microm and in the p48 fraction at 8 and 16 microm cyclic amp . cyclic amp-pde kinetic plots according to lineweaver-burk for the calculation of michaelis constants ( km ) and maximum enzyme velocities ( vmax ) were nonlinear , indicating both a low and high enzyme form . the michaelis constants were significantly lower in trained rats than those of its control for the high km form of cyclic amp-pde in the whole and soluble fractions and for the low km form of the p5 particulate fraction . the vmax of the high km form of the p48 particulate fraction from trained animals was also significantly higher than that found in its control . phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines in the various fractions was similar in both trained and sedentary animals . these changes in specific activity , michaelis constants , and vmax of cyclic amp-pde from crude homogenates of isolated fat cells from exercise trained animals may account for the decreased intracellular levels of cyclic amp following catecholamine stimulation of isolated fat cells from trained rats . 
microcomputer monitor and blood sampler for free-diving weddell seals . the equipment used for the first sampling of arterial blood at depth on free-diving weddell seals leptonychotes weddelli is described . blood was withdrawn through an aortic catheter by a submersible , peristaltic roller pump and stored in a single- or multiple-sample collection device . the multiple sampler allowed up to eight individual blood samples to be collected during a single dive . the blood pump was controlled by a dedicated microcomputer that allowed initiation of blood sampling at flexible combinations of depth and / or time during either the descending or ascending phase of the dive . the dedicated microcomputer also recorded swimming depth , velocity , heart rate , and body temperature at selectable time intervals . these data were transmitted to a laboratory computer , and blood samples were retrieved , when the seal surfaced to breathe . 
arterial vs . rectal temperature in ponies : rest , exercise , co2 inhalation , and thermal stresses . we assessed in ponies the adequacy of using rectal ( tre ) rather than arterial temperature ( tar ) under conditions common to ventilatory control experiments , i.e. , co2 breathing , thermal stress , and particularly exercise . we were interested in whether , and to what extent , tar-tre differences could lead to errors in arterial blood gas corrections . at control environmental temperatures ( ta ) of 5 degrees c in the winter and 21 degrees c in the summer , tar and tre ( 37.1 degrees c ) did not differ ( p greater than 0.05 ) . elevating winter or summer ta by 10-18 degrees c for 2-days or lowering summer ta by 9 degrees c ( 2-days ) did not change tar or tre ( p greater than 0.05 ) . furthermore , elevating inspired pco2 to 42 torr for 15 min did not alter tar or tre from control ( p greater than 0.05 ) . during treadmill exercise , at 1.8 mph 5 % grade , tar and tre did not change significantly ( p greater than 0.05 ) from rest by 11 min of work . at 3 mph 5 % grade , tar increased progressively by 0.3 degrees c ( p less than 0.05 ) while tre tended to increase 0.1 degree c by 11 min . during moderate exercise at 6 mph 5 % grade , tar increased 0.9 degree c ( p less than 0.05 ) while tre increased 0.25 degree c ( p less than 0.05 ) . finally , by 6 min of heavy exercise at 8 mph 20 % grade , tar increased 2 degrees c ( p less than 0.05 ) while tre increased 0.5 degree c ( p less than 0.05 ) . the tar-tre differences during the latter three work loads were statistically significant ( p less than 0.01 ) .

computation of respiratory heat exchanges . two sets of equations have been proposed to estimate the convective or sensible ( wcv ) and the evaporative or insensible ( wev ) respiratory heat exchanges . they are applicable both at sea-level barometric pressure with air breathing ( sla ) and in hypo- or hyperbaria in both air ( ha ) and artificial ( haa ) atmospheres . the only environmental parameters required are in sla : the temperature ( ti ) and the partial pressure of water vapor of the inspired air ( pih2o ) ; in ha : ti , pih2o , and the actual barometric pressure ( pb ) ; and in haa : it , pih2o , pb , the volumetric mass ( rho mix ) , and the specific heat ( cp mix ) of the breathed gas mixture . when no physiological data are available the results are expressed in energy units per liter of pulmonary ventilation ( wcv / v and wev / v ) in j x dm-3 btps . if the ventilation value ( v ) is known the results are obtained in units of power ( w ) . 
overestimation of sheep lung lymph contamination . we have previously reported that lymph from the chronic sheep lung lymph preparation contains 25-60 % lymph from nonpulmonary sources . in subsequent studies we found that the lymph flow rate from cannulated lymph vessels depends on the resistance and position of the lymph cannula . because we did not account for these factors in our estimate of the amount of nonpulmonary lymph in the sheep lung lymph preparation , our data were not accurate . we probably overestimated the amount of nonpulmonary lymph . however , the presence of nonpulmonary lymph remains a potentially serious problem with the sheep lung lymph preparation . 
an integrated model for the interaction of muscle relaxants with their antagonists . an integrated model describing the interaction of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with reversible anticholinesterase agents is derived and compared with a naive model using experimental data obtained from four anesthetized dogs . three consecutive but separate steady-state d-tubocurarine blocks ( approximately 50 , 70 , and 90 % ) were induced in each of the four dogs and reversed by short edrophonium infusions . edrophonium arterial concentrations and twitch tension of the anterior tibialis muscle were measured . both the integrated and the naive model were fit to the twitch tension data using a model with a hypothetical " effect " compartment . the integrated model consistently fit the twitch tension data better than the naive model ; the sum of squared deviations was lower by 46 , 45 , 87 , and 69 % , respectively , with the integrated model than with the naive model . also , in contrast to the naive model , the integrated model is capable of describing the interaction of the anticholinesterase agent and the neuromuscular blocking agent when the concentration of either varies with time .

physiology : is it time to cross the new frontier ? 
effects of subanesthetic doses of inert gases on behavioral thermoregulation in mice . mice exposed to subanesthetic partial pressures of n2o ( 0.25 to 0.75 atm ) or n2 ( 5.7 or 11.33 atm ) and allowed to choose between a warm and a cool environment showed a marked preference for the cooler environment . this behavior was associated with the onset of hypothermia , with deep body temperature falling by up to about 3 degrees c , usually to a new , steady level . both the length of time spent in the cooler environment and the degree of the hypothermia produced increased with the partial pressure of n2o or n2 used . the effects of n2o on behavioral thermoregulation and body temperature were reversible . there was a correlation between anesthetic potency and the ability of both gases to alter thermoregulation , suggesting that the effect of these agents on thermoregulation was caused by the same molecular interactions as those which underlie anesthesia . since both gases elicited changes in behavioral thermoregulation promoting rather than opposing the onset of hypothermia , it is concluded that they may have acted to lower the level at which deep body temperature was being regulated . 
effect of systemic venous pressure elevation on lymph flow and lung edema formation . pulmonary lymph drains into the thoracic duct and then into the systemic venous circulation . since systemic venous pressure ( svp ) must be overcome before pulmonary lymph can flow , variations in svp may affect lymph flow rate and therefore the rate of fluid accumulation within the lung . the importance of this issue is evident when one considers the variety of clinical interventions that increase svp and promote pulmonary edema formation , such as volume infusion , positive-pressure ventilation , and various vasoactive drug therapies . we recorded pulmonary arterial pressure ( pap ) , left atrial pressure ( lap ) , and svp in chronic unanesthetized sheep . occlusion balloons were placed in the left atrium and superior vena cava to control their respective pressures . the superior vena caval occluder was placed above the azygos vein so that bronchial venous pressure would not be elevated when the balloon was inflated . three-hour experiments were carried out at various lap levels with and without svp being elevated to 20 mmhg . the amount of fluid present in the lung was determined by the wet-to-dry weight ratio method . at control lap levels , no significant difference in lung fluid accumulation could be shown between animals with control and elevated svp levels . when lap was elevated above control a significantly greater amount of pulmonary fluid accumulated in animals with elevated svp levels compared with those with control svp levels . we conclude that significant excess pulmonary edema formation will occur when svp is elevated at pulmonary microvascular pressures not normally associated with rapid fluid accumulation . 
active and passive respiratory mechanics in anesthetized dogs . in six spontaneously breathing anesthetized dogs ( pentobarbital sodium , 30 mg / kg ) airflow , volume , and tracheal and esophageal pressures were measured . the active and passive mechanical properties of the total respiratory system , lung , and chest wall were calculated . the average passive values of respiratory system , lung , and chest wall elastances amounted to , respectively , 50.1 , 32.3 , and 17.7 cmh2o x l-1 . resistive pressure-vs.-flow relationships for the relaxed respiratory system , lung , and chest wall were also determined ; a linear relationship was found for the former ( the total passive intrinsic resistance averaged 4.1 cmh2o x l-1 x s ) , whereas power functions best described the others : the pulmonary pressure-flow relationship exhibited an upward concavity , which for the chest wall presented an upward convexity . the average active elastance and resistance of the respiratory system were , respectively , 64.0 cmh2o x l-1 and 5.4 cmh2o x l-1 x s . the greater active impedance reflects pressure losses due to force-length and force-velocity properties of the inspiratory muscles and those due to distortion of the respiratory system from its relaxed configuration . 
longevity of cold-exposed rats : a reevaluation of the " rate-of-living theory " . it has been postulated that increased energy expenditure results in shortened survival . to test this " rate-of-living theory " we examined the effect of raising energy expenditure by means of cold exposure on the longevity of rats . male 6-mo-old spf long-evans rats were gradually accustomed to immersion in cool water ( 23 degrees c ) . after 3 mo they were standing in the cool water for 4 h / day , 5 days / wk . they were maintained on this program until age 32 mo . the cold exposure resulted in a 44 % increase in food intake ( p less than 0.001 ) . despite their greater food intake , the cold-exposed rats ' body weights were significantly lower than those of control animals from age 11 to 32 mo . the average age at death of the cold-exposed rats was 968 + / - 141 days compared with 923 + / - 159 days for the controls . the cold exposure appeared to protect against neoplasia , particularly sarcomas ; only 24 % of the necropsied cold-exposed rats had malignancies compared with 57 % for the controls . the results of this study provide no support for the concept that increased energy expenditure decreases longevity . 
dose-response curves of central and peripheral airways to nicotine injections in dogs . the dose-response curves of the central and peripheral airways to intravenously injected nicotine were studied in 55 anesthetized dogs . with intact vagi , nicotine caused a dose-dependent increase in central airway resistance ( rc ) similar to the increase in peripheral airway resistance ( rp ) at concentrations ranging from 4 to 64 micrograms / kg . however , the responses of both rc and rp fell progressively when sequential doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms / kg were administered . with intact vagi and the administration of propranolol , there was a greater increase in rp than in rc at a nicotine dose of 64 micrograms / kg ( p less than 0.05 ) . with vagotomy , the responsiveness of both central and peripheral airways to nicotine decreased with doses of nicotine less than 64 micrograms / kg , but with doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms / kg the suppressive effect of nicotine on both rc and rp was less than that seen with intact vagi . under conditions in which the vagi were cut and atropine administered , the responsiveness of nicotine was even further depressed . combinations either of atropine and chlorpheniramine or atropine and phenoxybenzamine also completely blocked reactions to nicotine . additionally reactions to nicotine were completely blocked by hexamethonium . these results suggest that nicotine increases both rc and rp mainly through a vagal reflex and stimulation of the parasympathetic ganglia . 
influence of beta-adrenergic blockade on the control of sweating in humans . to evaluate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the control of human sweating , we studied six subjects during 40 min of cycle-ergometer exercise ( 60 % maximal o2 consumption ) at 22 degrees c 2 h after oral administration of placebo or nonselective beta-blockade ( bb , 80 mg propranolol ) . internal temperature ( esophageal temperature , tes ) , mean skin temperature ( tsk ) , local chest temperature ( tch ) , and local chest sweat rate ( msw ) were continuously recorded . the control of sweating was best described by the slope of the linear relationship between msw and tes and the threshold tes for the onset of sweating . the slope of the msw-tes relationship decreased 27 % ( p less than 0.01 ) , from 1.80 to 1.30 mg x cm-2 x min-1 x degree c-1 during bb . the tes threshold for sweating ( 36.8 degrees c ) was not altered as the result of bb . these data suggest that bb modified the control of sweating via some peripheral interaction . since tsk was significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) reduced during bb exercise , from a control value of 32.8 to 32.2 degrees c , we evaluated the influence of the reduction in local skin temperature ( tsk ) in the altered control of sweating . reductions in tch accounted for only 45 % of the decrease in the slope of the msw-tes relationship during bb . since evaporative heat loss requirement during exercise with bb , as estimated from the energy balance equation , was also reduced 18 % , compared with control exercise , we concluded that during bb the reduction in sweating at any tes is the consequence of both a decrease in local tsk and a direct effect on sweat gland . 
effect of hemorrhage on regional morphometric indexes of cerebral capillarity . this study was performed to determine whether the brain can increase the number of perfused capillaries and arterioles supplying it regionally during hemorrhage . this was done using a technique to simultaneously determine total and perfused regional arteriolar and capillary morphology . conscious long-evans rats served as unbled controls or were bled 65 mmhg or to 40-45 mmhg and stabilized for 30 min . regional cerebral blood flow was determined using [ 14c ] iodoantipyrine in half of these animals and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was injected in the other half for determination of perfused cerebral microvascular morphometric indexes . the total microvasculature was labeled postmortem via an alkaline phosphatase stain . regional cerebral blood flow was significantly increased in animals bled to 65 mmhg . during hemorrhage to 40-45 mmhg , cerebral blood flow was reduced 50 % ( from 59 + / - 28 to 26 + / - 11 ml x min-1 x 100 g-1 , mean + / - sd ) with no regional redistribution . for all treatments , total capillary density ranged from 400 to 500 capillaries / mm2 , and in controls 47 % were perfused . animals bled to 65 mmhg did not mobilize their unperfused microvascular reserve even though they showed a slight tendency to do so . during hemorrhage to 40-45 mmhg , this percent increased significantly to 57 % with the largest increase occurring in the pons . approximately 51 % of arterioles were perfused in controls and this was not different compared with the percent perfused during hemorrhage . despite the overall lack of mobilization of unperfused arterioles , some regions within the brain significantly mobilized their reserves with severe hemorrhage , e.g. , hippocampus ( 78 % ) , hypothalamus ( 67 % ) , and medulla ( 73 % ) .

arterial elasticity and physical working capacity in young men . we have tested the hypothesis that there is a positive relation between arterial elasticity and physical working capacity ( pwc ) at a given age . the subjects were 28 young men , 16-18 yr old . arterial elasticity was evaluated by measuring the carotid to femoral pulse-wave velocity ( c ) at rest . the slope , s ( c ) of the relation between c and the diastolic blood pressure was studied during a cold pressor test to test vascular reactivity . the relationship between heart rate ( hr ) and work load was determined using a cycle ergometer ; the variables measured were the slope of this relation s ( pwc ) and the power output at a hr of 170 min-1 ( pwc170 ) . the pwc170 ranged from 1.8 to 4.6 w / kg , and values of c ranged from 3.9 to 6.8 m / s . a strong inverse linear relation was found between c and pwc170 ( r = -0.76 ) , whereas the hr at rest was positively related to both c ( r = 0.68 ) and pwc170 ( r = 0.74 ) . there was no relationship between hr at rest and the slopes s ( c ) and s ( pwc ) ; the latter two variables depend mainly on the sympathetic response . these results show the importance of the intrinsic mechanical properties of the cardiovascular system , particularly arterial elasticity , in human adaptations to muscular exercise . 
ventilatory changes of pulmonary capillary blood volume assessed by arterial density . by use of an improved density measuring system , we found that the gravimetric density of arterial blood of dogs fluctuates at the same frequency as the spontaneous or mechanical ventilation . similar density fluctuations were observed in the blood leaving isolated , perfused lobes of dogs that were ventilated cyclicly . employing an analysis that balanced the erythrocyte and plasma flows through distensible capillaries containing blood with a tube hematocrit lower than the hematocrit in large blood vessels , we derived a relationship to estimate from the density fluctuation the change in pulmonary capillary blood volume ( vc ) . for mechanical ventilation , the maximum change in density over one ventilation cycle increased from 0.084 + / - 0.01 to 0.47 + / - 0.05 ( se ) g / l as the frequency decreased from 29 to 6 cycles / min . these density changes were estimated to be the result of an 1-16 % change in vc . a larger tidal volume for the mechanical ventilation led to a larger density fluctuation . the maximum density change of spontaneous respiration of 6 cycles / min was one-sixth of the mechanical case , indicating a much smaller change in vc during spontaneous respiration . when the airway flow resistance was increased for spontaneous respiration , larger density fluctuations were observed . 
skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rats having growth hormone-secreting tumor . plantaris muscle hypertrophy resulting from surgical ablation of the synergistic gastrocnemius muscle was compared between nontumor- and gh3 tumor-bearing rat groups ( n = 8-10 ) . gh3 cells ( 10 ( 6 ) ) were subcutaneously injected into 150-g female wistar-furth rats to initiate the tumor . after 17 days , the tumor-bearing rats gained 5.7 g body wt / day compared with 2.0 for the nontumor-bearing rats . the left gastrocnemius muscle was surgically removed from both nontumor and tumor groups . the gastrocnemius was removed from the tumor group after an increased growth rate was achieved . seven days after surgery , the animals were killed and plantaris muscles were removed . the wet weight of the left plantaris muscle increased 45.6 and 44.0 % over the unoperated contralateral control ( right side ) in the nontumor and tumor groups , respectively . the right control plantaris muscle in the tumor group was 63 % heavier than the right control plantaris from the nontumor group ; however , the proportion of body weight for plantaris was similar between the two groups . the effect of gastrocnemius ablation and tumor treatment on plantaris weight was additive , and the percent increase over the unoperated contralateral control side was similar between the two groups . these data demonstrate that skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs in adult animals in which growth has been stimulated by a growth hormone-secreting tumor and could suggest that the muscle growth response caused by the tumor is operating by a mechanism different than work-induced hypertrophy . 
effect of rib cage and abdominal restriction on total respiratory resistance and reactance . in 14 healthy male subjects we studied the effects of rib cage and abdominal strapping on lung volumes , airway resistance ( raw ) , and total respiratory resistance ( rrs ) and reactance ( xrs ) . rib cage , as well as abdominal , strapping caused a significant decrease in vital capacity ( respectively , -36 and -34 % ) , total lung capacity ( tlc ) ( -31 and -27 % ) , functional residual capacity ( frc ) ( -28 and -28 % ) , and expiratory reserve volume ( -40 and -48 % ) and an increase in specific airway conductance ( +24 and +30 % ) and in maximal expiratory flow at 50 % of control tlc ( +47 and +42 % ) . the decrease of residual volume ( rv ) was significant ( -12 % ) with rib cage strapping only . abdominal strapping resulted in a minor overall increase in rrs , whereas rib cage strapping produced a more marked increase at low frequencies ; thus a frequency dependence of rrs was induced . a similar pattern , but with lower absolute values , of rrs was obtained by thoracic strapping when the subject was breathing at control frc . xrs was decreased , especially at low frequencies , with abdominal strapping and even more with thoracic strapping ; thus the resonant frequency of the respiratory system was shifted toward higher frequencies . partitioning rrs and xrs into resistance and reactance of lungs and chest wall demonstrated that the different effects of chest wall and abdominal strapping on rrs and xrs reflect changes mainly of chest wall mechanics . 
respiratory distress and surfactant inhibition following vagotomy in rabbits . we used the model of bilateral cervical vagotomy of adult rabbits to cause respiratory failure characterized by pulmonary edema , decreased lung compliance , and atelectasis . we documented an 18-fold increase in radiolabeled albumin leak from the vascular space into alveolar washes of vagotomy vs . sham-operated rabbits ( p less than 0.01 ) . despite a twofold increase in percent of prelabeled saturated phosphatidylcholine secreted ( p less than 0.01 ) , the alveolar wash saturated phosphatidylcholine pool sizes were not different . the minimum surface tensions were 19.6 + / - 2.5 vs . 9.4 + / - 2.2 dyn / cm for alveolar washes from vagotomy and control rabbits , respectively ( p less than 0.01 ) . the soluble proteins from alveolar washes inhibited the surface tension lowering properties of natural surfactant , whereas those from the control rabbits did not ( p less than 0.01 ) . when vagotomy rabbits in respiratory failure were treated with 50 mg natural surfactant lipid per kilogram arterial blood gas values and compliances improved relative to control rabbits . vagotomy results in alveolar pulmonary edema , and surfactant dysfunction despite normal surfactant pool sizes and respiratory failure . a surfactant treatment can improve the respiratory failure . 
skeletal muscle characteristics in sedentary black and caucasian males . twenty-three male black african and 23 male caucasian subjects , ascertained as sedentary , participated in this study designed to determine whether there were differences in skeletal muscle histochemical and biochemical characteristics between racial groups . muscle fiber type proportions ( i , iia , and iib ) , fiber areas and activities of several enzyme markers of different energy metabolic pathways were determined from a biopsy of the vastus lateralis . results indicated that caucasians had a higher percent type i ( 8 % , p less than 0.01 ) and a lower percent type iia ( 6.7 % , p less than 0.05 ) fiber proportions than africans . no significant differences were observed between the two racial groups in the type iib fiber proportion or in the three fiber type areas . enzymes catalyzing reactions in phosphagenic [ creatine kinase ( ck ) ] and glycolytic [ hexokinase ( hk ) , phosphofructokinase ( pfk ) , and lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) ] metabolic pathways had significantly higher activities ( about 30-40 % ) in the black african group than in the caucasian group ( p less than 0.01 ) . no significant difference was noted in the activities of oxidative enzymes [ malate dehydrogenase ( mdh ) , oxoglutarate dehydrogenase ( ogdh ) , and 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase ( hadh ) ] . consequently , the pfk / ogdh ratio was significantly elevated in africans ( p less than 0.05 ) . the racial differences observed between africans and caucasians in fiber type proportion and enzyme activities of the phosphagenic and glycolytic metabolic pathways may well result from inherited variation . these data suggest that sedentary male black individuals are , in terms of skeletal muscle characteristics , well endowed for sport events of short duration . 
effects of adenosine on ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in humans . adenosine infusion ( 100 micrograms x kg-1 x min-1 ) in humans stimulates ventilation but also causes abdominal and chest discomfort . to exclude the effects of symptoms and to differentiate between a central and peripheral site of action , we measured the effect of adenosine infused at a level ( 70-80 micrograms x kg-1 x min-1 ) below the threshold for symptoms . resting ventilation ( ve ) and progressive ventilatory responses to isocapnic hypoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia were measured in six normal men . compared with a control saline infusion given single blind on the same day , adenosine stimulated ve [ mean increase : 1.3 + / - 0.8 ( sd ) l / min ; p less than 0.02 ] , lowered resting end-tidal pco2 ( petco2 ) ( mean fall : -3.9 + / - 0.9 torr ) , and increased heart rate ( mean increase : 16.1 + / - 8.1 beats / min ) without changing systemic blood pressure . adenosine increased the hypoxic ventilatory response ( control : -0.68 + / - 0.4 l x min-1 x % sao2-1 , where % sao2 is percent of arterial o2 saturation ; adenosine : -2.40 + / - 1.2 l x min-1 x % sao2-1 ; p less than 0.01 ) measured at a mean petco2 of 38.3 + / - 0.6 torr but did not alter the hypercapnic response . this differential effect suggests that adenosine may stimulate ventilation by a peripheral rather than a central action and therefore may be involved in the mechanism of peripheral chemoreception . 
effects of digoxin on diaphragmatic strength generation . contrary to hindlimb muscle , extracellular calcium plays an important role in diaphragmatic strength generation ( j . appl . physiol . 58 : 2054-61 , 1985 ) . since the inotropic effect of digitalis appears to be related to cell membrane transport of calcium , we studied the effect of digoxin on diaphragmatic contractility in 20 anesthetized dogs . the diaphragm was electrically stimulated with intramuscular electrodes . the transdiaphragmatic pressure ( pdi ) during supramaximal ( 50 v ) 2-s stimulations applied over a frequency range of 10-100 hz was measured with balloon catheters at functional residual capacity . cardiac output was measured with a swan-ganz catheter and diaphragmatic blood flow ( qdi ) by timed volume collections of left inferior venous effluent . the force generated by the sartorius muscle during electrical stimulations was studied concomitantly to pdi . in 10 dogs ( group a ) 0.04 mg / kg of digoxin was infused in 10 min . in 10 other dogs ( group b ) 0.2 mg / kg was administered . all measurements were performed during control and 30 , 60 , 90 , and 120 min after digoxin administration . in group a , digoxin plasmatic level at 60 min reached a therapeutic range in all dogs ( 1.8 + / - 0.3 ng / ml ) , whereas in group b , digoxin plasmatic level was higher ( 8 + / - 1.3 ng / ml ) . no significant change in cardiac output and qdi was noted after administration of digoxin , either in the dogs of group a or those of group b .

diaphragmatic contractility after upper abdominal surgery . postoperative dysfunction of the diaphragm has been reported after upper abdominal surgery . this study was designed to determine whether an impairment in diaphragmatic contractility was involved in the genesis of the diaphragmatic dysfunction observed after upper abdominal surgery . five patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery were studied . the following measurements were performed before and 4 h after surgery : vital capacity ( vc ) , functional residual capacity ( frc ) , and forced expiratory volume in 1 s . diaphragmatic function was also assessed using the ratio of changes in gastric pressure ( delta pga ) over changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure ( delta pdi ) . finally contractility of the diaphragm was determined by measuring the change in delta pdi generated during bilateral electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves ( pdi stim ) . diaphragmatic dysfunction occurred in all the patients after upper abdominal surgery as assessed by a marked decrease in delta pga / delta pdi from 0.480 + / - 0.040 to -0.097 + / - 0.152 ( p less than 0.01 ) 4 h after surgery compared with preoperative values . vc also markedly decreased after upper abdominal surgery from 3 , 900 + / - 630 to 2 , 060 + / - 520 ml ( p less than 0.01 ) 4 h after surgery . in contrast , no change in frc and pdi stim was observed 4 h after surgery . in contrast , no change in frc and pdi stim was observed 4 h after upper abdominal surgery compared with the preoperative values . we conclude that contractility of the diaphragm is not altered after upper abdominal surgery , and diaphragmatic dysfunction is secondary to other mechanisms such as possible reflexes arising from the periphery ( chest wall and / or peritoneum ) , which could inhibit the phrenic nerve output . 
sex and training differences in human growth hormone levels during prolonged exercise . human growth hormone ( hgh ) levels were measured during rest , prolonged treadmill exercise at 60 % maximum o2 uptake ( vo2max ) , and immediate recovery in four groups of subjects ( n = 7 / group ) , ages 21-30 yr , classified as male runners ( mr ) , female runners ( fr ) , male controls ( mc ) , and female controls ( fc ) to determine whether sex differences in the hgh response are related to resting 17 beta-estradiol ( e2 ) and / or cardiorespiratory endurance ( cre ) . glucose ( glc ) , e2 , and hgh levels were determined from serial blood samples taken from an intravenous catheter . glc did not change significantly during exercise , but different trends for the runners ( increases ) vs . controls ( decreases ) resulted in higher ( p less than 0.01 ) postexercise levels in the runners . resting hgh was higher ( p less than 0.05 ) in the frs and fcs than the mrs and mcs , respectively , and continued to be higher in the fcs ( vs . mcs ) during the first 30 min of exercise . the mrs achieved higher peak hgh levels and exhibited higher values than the mcs throughout exercise and recovery . there were no statistically significant training differences in the females . the strongest predictors for peak hgh were absolute work load and group ( runners vs . controls ) , both of which combined accounted for 32-36 % of the variability ( p less than 0.01 ) in hgh response . significant sex-related variables ( sex , resting e2 ) accounted for 11-19 % of the variability in peak or percent change in hgh , with e2 having a positive effect at rest but a negative effect during exercise .

pulmonary vascular compliance and viscoelasticity . when dog lung lobes were perfused at constant arterial inflow rate , occlusion of the venous outflow ( vo ) produced a rapid jump in venous pressure ( pv ) followed by a slower rise in both arterial pressure ( pa ) and pv . during the slow rise pa ( t ) and pv ( t ) tended to converge and become concave upward as the volume of blood in the lungs increased . we compared the dynamic vascular volume vs . pressure curves obtained after vo with the static volume vs . pressure curves obtained by dye dilution . the slope of the static curve ( the static compliance , cst ) was always larger than the slope of the dynamic curve ( the dynamic compliance , cdyn ) . in addition , the cdyn decreased with increasing blood flow rate . when venous occlusion ( vo ) was followed after a short time interval by arterial occlusion ( ao ) such that the lobe was isovolumic , both pa and pv fell with time to a level that was below either pressure at the instant of ao . in an attempt to explain these observations a compartmental model was constructed in which the hemodynamic resistance and vascular compliance were volume dependent and the vessel walls were viscoelastic . these features of the model could account for the convergence and upward concavity of the pa and pv curves after vo and the pressure relaxation in the isovolumic state after ao , respectively . according to the model analysis , the difference between cst and cdyn and the flow dependence of cdyn are due to wall viscosity and volume dependence of compliance , respectively . model analysis also suggested ways of evaluating changes in the viscoelasticity of the lobar vascular bed . hypoxic vasoconstriction that increased total vascular resistance also decreased cst and cdyn and appeared to increase the vessel wall viscosity . 
relationship between diaphragm length and abdominal dimensions . we examined the relationship between changes in abdominal cross-sectional area , measured by respiratory inductive plethysmography , and changes in length in the costal and crural parts of the diaphragm , measured by sonomicrometry , in nine supine , anesthetized dogs . during passive inflation , both parts of the diaphragm shortened and abdominal cross-sectional area increased . during passive deflation , both parts of the diaphragm lengthened and abdominal cross-sectional area decreased . we subsequently used the relationship between costal and crural diaphragmatic length , respectively , and abdominal cross-sectional area during passive inflation-deflation to predict the length changes in the costal and crural diaphragm during quiet breathing before and after bilateral phrenicotomy . in the intact animal the inspiratory shortening in the crural diaphragm was almost invariably greater than predicted from the relationship during passive inflation . during inspiration after phrenicotomy the crural diaphragm invariably lengthened , whereas the costal diaphragm often shortened . in general there was a good correlation between the measured and predicted length change for the crural diaphragm ( r = 0.72 before and 0.79 after phrenicotomy ) and a poor one for the costal diaphragm ( r = 0.05 before and 0.19 after phrenicotomy ) . 
lymph flow and lung weight in isolated sheep lungs . to study the relationship between lung weight and lymph flow , we used an in situ , isolated sheep lung preparation that allowed these two variables to be measured simultaneously . all lungs were perfused for 4.5 h at a constant rate of 100 ml x min-1 x kg-1 . in control lungs , the left atrial pressure ( pla ) was kept at atmospheric pressure . in experimental lungs , pla was kept atmospheric except for a 50-min elevation to 18 mmhg midway through the perfusion . during this period of left atrial hypertension , pulmonary arterial pressure rose from 18 to 31 mmhg , lymph flow rose from 3 to 12 ml / h , and the lymph-to-plasma oncotic pressure ratio ( pi l / pi p ) fell from 0.7 to 0.48 . after left atrial pressure was returned to control , pulmonary arterial pressure , lymph flow , and pi l / pi p all returned to control levels . the rate of weight gain after the return of left atrial pressure to control was also the same as that in the control group . however , during the period of left atrial hypertension 135 ml of fluid were filtered into the lung , and this large increase in lung weight remained after the pressure was lowered . the presence of this substantial excess lung water despite control values for vascular pressures , lymph flow , rate of weight gain , and pi l / pi p suggests that the absolute amount of lung water has little influence on the dynamic aspects of lung fluid balance . these results are consistent with a two-compartment model of the interstitial space , where only one of the compartments is readily drained by the lymphatics . 
co2 elimination by high-frequency oscillation : effects of vagosympathetic stimulation . the effects of electrical stimulation of the vagi on gas transport mediated by high-frequency , low tidal volume ventilation ( hfv ) was examined in 10 anesthetized , paralyzed , propranolol-treated dogs . gas transport efficiency was estimated by measuring the rate of co2 removed from the lungs ( vco2 ) achieved during 45-s bursts of hfv applied before ( control 1 ) , during , and after ( control 2 ) electrical stimulation of the transected vagi . during vagal stimulation the heart rate was maintained by electrical pacing . during the 15-s phase of vagal stimulation pulmonary impedance increased from 3.6 + / - 0.7 to 6.2 + / - 2.2 cmh2o x l-1 x s , and vco2 increased . when the electrical stimulation of the vagi was stopped , impedance and vco2 returned to prestimulation values . vco2 was always higher during electrical stimulation of the vagi when hfv of a fixed volume was applied over a range of frequencies or when a fixed oscillation frequency was used over a range of tidal volumes . the effects of vagal stimulation on hfv-mediated gas transport were quite similar to the effects of moving the locations of the bias flow inlet and outlet into the lung such that tracheal volume was decreased by 20 ml , an amount equivalent to estimated change in control airway volume thought to occur during vagal stimulation . we simulated the effects of vagal stimulation and decreased tracheal volume on vco2 by using a previously described model of hfv-mediated gas transport .

atropine unmasks bed-rest effect : a spectral analysis of cardiac interbeat intervals . bed-rest deconditioning is suspected to reduce cardiac reserve , possibly by impairing autonomic function . heart rate response in normal subjects reveals considerable variability , reflected by a relatively broadband interbeat interval power spectrum . a reduction in this autonomically modulated variability would be predicted to cause a narrowing of the spectrum . we retrospectively analyzed data from 10 aerobically conditioned men ( age range 35-49 yr ) who had undergone orthostatic tolerance testing with lower body negative pressure pre-bed rest and after 7-10 days of bed rest , while on placebo and after intravenous atropine . spectra were derived by fourier analysis of 128 interbeat interval data sets . spectral power was estimated by computing the root-mean-square ( rms ) values ( mean + / - sd ) for the band encompassing the 2nd to 64th harmonics from subjects with a sufficient number of beats : placebo rms is 93 + / - 33 ms for pre-bed rest and 84 + / - 38 ms for bed rest ( ns , n = 6 ) ; atropine rms is 63 + / - 24 ms for pre-bed rest and 40 + / - 23 ms for bed rest ( p less than 0.01 ; n = 7 ) . these data suggest that atropine " unmasks " a deconditioning effect of bed rest in athletic men , evidenced by a reduction in interbeat interval spectral power not apparent with placebo . spectral analysis offers a useful means of quantitating the effects of bed-rest deconditioning and autonomic perturbations on cardiac dynamics . 
effects of dextran-bound inhibitors on carbonic anhydrase activity in isolated rat lungs . effects of macromolecular prontosil-dextran inhibitors ( pd ) on carbonic anhydrase ( ca ) activity in isolated rat lungs were studied . isolated lungs were perfused with krebs-ringer bicarbonate ( krb ) solutions containing no inhibitor , pd 100 , 000 ( mol wt 100 , 000 ) , pd 5 , 000 ( mol wt 5 , 000 ) , or low-molecular-weight inhibitors ( prontosil or acetazolamide ) . the time course of effluent perfusate ph equilibration was measured in a stop-flow ph electrode apparatus . pulmonary co2 excretion ( vco2 ) was monitored by continuously recording expired co2 concentration . the lungs were ventilated with room air and perfused at 37 degrees c with krb prebubbled with 5 % co2- 20 % o2- 75 % n2 . the results obtained show that both the low-molecular-weight inhibitors and pd 's caused postcapillary ph disequilibria ( delta ph ) in effluent perfusate . however , only acetazolamide and prontosil caused a reduction in vco2 . these results suggest that there is an intravascular ca , presumably associated with endothelial cell membranes , that is accessible to all inhibitors used and is responsible in part for equilibration of the co2- hco3- -h+ reactions in the perfusate but , under the conditions used , does not affect co2 excretion ; and there is an extravascular ( possibly intracellular ) ca that can be inhibited by low-molecular-weight inhibitors , is primarily responsible for enhanced co2 transfer across the alveolar-capillary barrier ( perhaps via facilitation of co2 diffusion ) , and is in part responsible for ph equilibration . 
effect of expiratory loading on expiratory duration and pulmonary stretch receptor discharge . slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors have been hypothesized to be the afferents mediating the vagally dependent , volume-related prolongation of expiratory time ( te ) during expiratory loading . it has been further suggested that the vagal component of this prolongation of te is due to the temporal summation of pulmonary stretch receptor ( psr ) activity during expiratory loading . this hypothesis was tested in rabbits exposed to resistive and elastic single-breath expiratory loading while psr 's were simultaneously recorded . both types of loads resulted in a decreased expired volume ( ve ) and increased expiratory duration ( te ) . the te for resistive loads were significantly greater than for elastic loads for equivalent ve . thus two different ve-te relationships were found for resistive and elastic loads . when te was plotted against the area under the expired volume trajectory , a single linear relationship was observed . psr activity recorded during expiratory loading increased as ve decreased and te increased . a single linear relationship resulted when the number of psr spikes during the expiration was plotted against the associated te for all types of loads . these findings demonstrate that the volume-related prolongation of te with single-breath expiratory loads is associated with an increase in psr discharge . these results support the hypothesis that the vagal component of load-dependent prolongation of te is a function of both the temporal and spatial summation of psr activity during the expiratory phase . 
effect of posture on vital capacity . the influence of some extreme body postures on vital capacity ( vc ) was examined in young adult humans . two postures required full support of body weight by the arms : arms up , hanging from a bar , and arms down with hands gripping parallel bars . three involved muscles that flex and extend the trunk : a partial sit-up position while supine and nearly maximal spinal extension and flexion while standing . changes at the inspiratory and expiratory volume extremes were recognized by having the subjects do two vc efforts : the first standing and the second in the posture in question while continuing to breathe on the spirometer . control observations in which the second of a vc pair was performed in an unstressed posture allowed correction for the influence of rebreathing . the changes in corrected vc were small , the greatest being an average reduction of approximately 8 % in the partial sit-up position . during full support of body weight by the arms , the vc was slightly increased due to a significant increase in the inspiratory extreme and no change in the expiratory extreme . spinal extension produced small increases in lung volume at both extremes with no significant change in vc , whereas spinal flexion did not influence the upper extreme but did increase lung volume at the lower extreme . the changes are discussed in terms of trunk muscle action . 
distortion of calculated whole-body hematocrit during lower-body immersion in water . we found a difference between the venous hematocrits of immersed and nonimmersed arms during immersion of the lower body in cold water but not during a comparable exposure to warm water . fourteen healthy men were exposed to three different experimental conditions : arm immersion , body immersion , and control . the men always sat upright while both upper extremities hung vertically at their sides . during arm immersion , one forearm was completely immersed for 30 min in either cold water ( 28 degrees c , n = 7 ) or warm water ( 38 degrees c , n = 7 ) . this cold-warm water protocol was repeated on separate days for exposure to the remaining conditions of body immersion ( immersion of 1 forearm and all tissues below the xiphoid process ) and control ( no immersion ) . blood samples were simultaneously drawn from cannulated veins in both antecubital fossae . hematocrit difference ( hct diff ) was measured by subtracting the nonimmersed forearm 's hematocrit ( hct dry ) from the immersed forearm 's hematocrit ( hct wet ) . hct diff was approximately zero when the men were exposed to the control condition and body immersion in warm water . in the remaining conditions , hct wet dropped below hct dry ( p less than 0.01 , 3-way analysis of variance ) . the decrements of hct diff showed there were differences between venous hematocrits in immersed and nonimmersed regions of the body , indicating that changes of the whole-body hematocrit cannot be calculated from a large-vessel hematocrit soon after immersing the lower body in cold water . 
respiratory muscle interaction during nrem sleep in patients with occlusive apnea . to study respiratory muscle interaction in patients with occlusive apnea , diaphragmatic electromyogram ( emgdi ) and gastric , pleural , and transdiaphragmatic pressures ( pga , ppl , and pdi , respectively ) were studied in seven patients during non-rapid-eye-movement ( nrem ) sleep . diaphragmatic force output , as assessed by pdi , followed the periodic changes in emgdi but during the occlusive phase the increase in pdi was more than the increase in emgdi . this increase in pdi was essentially due to an increase in ppl , since pga and emgdi had a linear relationship ( r = 0.98 , p less than 0.001 ) that did not change during the occlusive and ventilatory phases . abdominal muscle recruitment evident in pga and abdominal motion tracings during the occlusive phase when paradoxical rib cage motion was observed suggested that this increase in diaphragmatic efficiency was likely due to a change in diaphragmatic length-tension characteristics . these results demonstrate that , in patients with occlusive apneas , the diaphragm is the predominant respiratory muscle during nrem sleep and that its function is supported by abdominal muscle recruitment . 
role of the nose in resistive load detection . previous resistive load detection ( rld ) studies have ignored the nose , the usual route of breathing . weber 's law predicts the delta r50 ( the added load detectable on 50 % of presentations ) to be a fixed percent of the background resistance ( r0 ) and thus the delta r50 / r0 ratio ( the weber fraction ) is constant . we have noted the nose to be sensitive to added load , we wondered if the nose might play a role in rld . to determine whether this was true and to characterize the effects of changes in r0 in the range of normal nasal resistance ( rn ) , we determined r0 and delta r50 using standard techniques under the following conditions : nose vs . decongested nose , nose vs . nose with added external r0 ( 3.0 and 8.0 cmh2o x l-1 x s ) , nose vs . anesthetized nose , nose vs . mouth , and mouth vs . mouth with added load ( 3 cmh2o x l-1 x s ) . we found that decongestant decreased rn [ 4.3 + / - 0.6 ( se ) to 3.1 + / - 0.5 cmh2o x l-1 x s , p less than 0.05 ] and delta r50 ( 1.7 + / - 0.5 to 1.1 + / - 0.3 cmh2o x l-1 x s , p less than 0.05 ) . when an external load of 3 cmh2o x l-1 x s was added to the nose , delta r50 did not change significantly ( 1.4 + / - 0.2 to 1.1 + / - 0.2 cmh2o x l-1 x s ) , but the weber fraction decreased ( 0.28 + / - 0.05 to 0.15 + / - 0.03 , p less than 0.02 ) .

adrenergic and local control of o2 uptake during and after severe hypoxia . the distribution of whole-body o2 supply during severe hypoxia and recovery and its relation to the regional distribution of o2 deficit and repayment was studied . mongrel dogs were anesthetized , paralyzed , and ventilated to maintain an end-tidal pco2 between 35 and 40 torr . in one group , the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked to eliminate neural and humoral adrenergic influences . in a second group , alpha-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to decrease o2 delivery by excessive vasoconstriction . in a third group , beta-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to increase o2 delivery . whole-body and hindlimb muscle o2 uptake and vascular responses were measured during normoxic control , 15 or 30 min of severe hypoxia ( 9 % o2 in n2 ) , and 20 or 30 min of normoxic recovery , respectively . the whole-body o2 deficit and excess o2 uptake in recovery were partitioned into muscle and nonmuscle areas . the data showed that neural or humoral influences had little effect on the regional distribution of the total o2 deficit and o2 excess in recovery . the o2 deficit could be decreased somewhat by increasing delivery , but the amount of excess o2 used in recovery was unaffected . this suggested that the excess o2 use in recovery was more a function of an energy deficit during hypoxia and not an o2 deficit . 
mechanism of peptidoleukotriene-induced increases in pulmonary transvascular fluid filtration . we examined the effects of leukotrienes c4 ( ltc4 ) and d4 ( ltd4 ) ( 1 microgram ) on the pulmonary vascular filtration coefficient , a measure of vessel wall conductivity to water , and the alterations in pulmonary vascular resistance ( pvr ) in isolated-perfused guinea pig lungs . we also assessed whether ltc4 and ltd4 increased the permeability to albumin in cultured monolayers of pulmonary artery endothelial cells . in ringer-perfused and blood-perfused lungs , ltc4 resulted in increases in pulmonary arterial pressure ( ppa ) and the pulmonary capillary pressure ( pcap ) measured as the equilibration pressure after simultaneous pulmonary arterial and venous occlusions . pulmonary venous resistance ( rv ) increased to a greater extent than arterial resistance ( ra ) in both ringer-perfused and blood-perused lungs challenged with ltc4 . the greater increase in pvr in blood-perfused lungs corresponded with a greater elevation of lung effluent thromboxane b2 ( txb2 ) concentration . the ltc4-stimulated increase in pvr was prevented by pretreatment with meclofenamate ( 10 ( -4 ) m ) . ltd4 also induced rapid increases in ppa and pcap in both ringer-perfused and blood-perfused lungs ; however , ppa decreased before stabilizing at a pressure higher than base line . the increases in rv with ltd4 were greater than ra . the ltd4-stimulated increases in ra and rv also paralleled the elevation in txb2 concentration . as with ltc4 , the increases in ppa , pcap , pvr , and txb2 concentration were greater in blood-perfused than in ringer-perfused lungs . pretreatment with meclofenamate reduced the magnitude of the initial increase in ppa , but did not prevent the response .

propranolol does not impair exercise oxygen uptake in normal men at high altitude . decreased maximal o2 uptake ( vo2max ) and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system have been previously shown to occur at high altitude . we hypothesized that tachycardia mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation acted to defend vo2max at high altitude . propranolol treatment beginning before high-altitude ( 4 , 300 m ) ascent reduced heart rate during maximal and submaximal exercise in six healthy men treated with propranolol ( 80 mg three times daily ) compared with five healthy subjects receiving placebo ( lactose ) . compared with sea-level values , the vo2max fell on day 2 at high altitude , but the magnitude of fall was similar in the placebo and propranolol treatment groups ( 26 + / - 6 vs . 32 + / - 5 % , p = ns ) and vo2max remained similar at high altitude in both groups once treatment was discontinued . during 30 min of submaximal ( 80 % of vo2max ) exercise , propranolol-treated subjects maintained o2 uptake levels that were as large as those in placebo subjects . the maintenance of maximal or submaximal levels of o2 uptake in propranolol-treated subjects at 4 , 300 m could not be attributed to increased minute ventilation , arterial o2 saturation , or hemoglobin concentration . rather , it appeared that propranolol-treated subjects maintained o2 uptake by transporting a greater proportion of the o2 uptake with each heartbeat . thus , contrary to our hypothesis , beta-adrenergic blockade did not impair maximal or submaximal o2 uptake at high altitude due perhaps to compensatory mechanisms acting to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output . 
effect of graded erythrocythemia on cardiovascular and metabolic responses to exercise . the effects of graded induced erythrocythemia on cardiovascular and metabolic responses to intense treadmill running were studied in four highly trained endurance runners . three autologous infusions of 1 unit ( u ) whole blood ( 450 ml / u ) were administered sequentially 2-7 days apart . maximal o2 consumption ( vo2max ) increased from 5.04 l / min at control ( c ) to 5.24 l / min after 2 u ( r2 ) and 5.38 l / min after 3 u ( r3 ) . cardiac output during treadmill running at 91 % control vo2max was 28.2 l / min at c , 29.8 l / min at r2 , and 33.1 l / min at r3 . corresponding heart rates were unchanged , and stroke volume was increased at r3 . peak lactate concentration was reduced , and arterial acid-base status improved at r2 and r3 after standardized bouts of intense exercise . arterial blood pressures and electrocardiograms during exercise were not affected by erythrocythemia . we conclude that the reinfusion of up to 3 u of autologous blood into highly trained endurance runners who have normal hematology does not adversely affect their cardiovascular response to maximal exercise . in addition , the increases in vo2max following reinfusion of 2 u , and again after 3 u , suggest that the aerobic power of the working muscles was not surpassed at these levels of erythrocythemia . 
ph measurement in human skeletal muscle samples : effect of phosphagen hydrolysis . measurements of muscle ph ( phm ) with the homogenate technique are routinely made when extensive phosphagen hydrolysis has occurred . upon exposure of the homogenate to 37 degrees c in the ph meter , phosphocreatine and atp were rapidly degraded to 35 and 60 % of control concentrations after 30 s . attempts at chemically arresting this hydrolysis were unsuccessful . therefore we examined the significance of phosphagen hydrolysis on phm measurement in human biopsies taken at rest and following intense electrical stimulation . to accomplish this , phm was measured at 0 degree c , where extensive hydrolysis did not occur . on the same homogenate , phm was measured at 0 degree c with phosphagens and at 0 and 37 degrees c after phosphagen hydrolysis . the effect of phosphagen hydrolysis on phm at 0 degrees c was used to estimate this effect at 37 degrees c . in resting samples , phosphagen hydrolysis produced a nonsignificant acidification of 0.008 ph units and , in electrically stimulated samples , a nonsignificant alkalinization of 0.033 units . measurements of homogenate pco2 suggested that most of the co2 remained in the sample during phm measurement at 37 degrees c . the present work substantiates the use of the homogenate technique as an accurate and practical method for the estimation of intracellular ph in resting and exercise human muscle samples . 
airflow characteristics in a baboon nasal passage cast . airflow patterns in the nasal passages influence the distribution of air-pollutant-induced lesions in the airway mucosa . little is known about airflow characteristics of the complex nasopharyngeal airway of humans and experimental animals . airflow characteristics in the nasopharyngeal airways of an adult male baboon ( 13.9 kg body wt ) were investigated with thermistor probes and the findings compared with flow visualization , using a cinephotographic technique . a clear , acrylic , hollow cast of a baboon nose was made , and thermistor probes were inserted to record air velocity in the cast lumen using a wind tunnel to propel air through the cast . an identical cast was studied by passing water through the cast , with pulses of dye to reveal flow , and cinephotography was used for determination of flow velocities and flow patterns . flow rates adjusted on the basis of a reynolds conversion showed good correlations between the two methods , whereas cinephotography revealed areas of turbulence and vortex-like flow not detected by thermistor probes . these results suggest that water flow may provide useful information in complex airways where airflow cannot be determined by other methods . 
validity / reliability of sweat analysis by whole-body washdown vs . regional collections . six subjects ( 25.3 + / - 3.3 yr , mean + / - sd ) exercised for 60 min at 42 + / - 4 [ low ( l ) ] , 55 + / - 6 [ moderate ( m ) ] , and 67 + / - 4 % vo2max [ high ( h ) ] in a moderate environment . sweat collected from upper back ( ub ) , lower back ( lb ) , midchest ( mc ) , stomach ( s ) , and thigh ( t ) areas as well as by whole-body washdown ( w ) was analyzed for urea nitrogen ( n ) . with the exception of the l where all regional measures were similar , all sites overestimated w ( several significantly , p less than 0.05 ) . regression analysis estimations of w ( mg / h ) from regional collections were as follows--l : w = 0.727 ( s ) - 1.366 ( ub ) + 1.181 ( t ) + 65.470 + / - 29.5 , r = 0.90 ; m : w = 0.598 ( mc ) - 0.649 ( ub ) + 0.244 ( lb ) + 43.238 + / - 30.4 , r = 0.99 ; h : w = 0.274 ( s ) - 0.560 ( t ) + 0.223 ( mc ) + 131.104 + / - 4.3 , r = 0.99 ; all intensities : w = 0.497 ( mc ) - 0.483 ( t ) + 0.112 ( lb ) + 69.554 + / - 31.5 , r = 0.96 . w recovery of exogenous urea n applied to each subject 's body was 98.3 + / - 2.7 % ( mean + / - se ) . interinvestigator reliability coefficient ( r = 0.511 ) was significant ( p less than 0.01 ) but relatively low and the between investigator urea n recovery ( 93.3 + / - 3.7 vs . 103.2 + / - 3.5 % ) was significantly different ( p less than 0.05 ) . repeated w determinations by the same investigator were not different ( p greater than 0.05 ) , but intrainvestigator reliability coefficients differed widely ( 0.385 vs . 0.820 ) . together , these data indicate that w solute recovery can be high ; however , both inter- and intrainvestigator reliability can vary .

energy cost minimization in left ventricular ejection : an optimal control model . a new optimization model for explaining the observed left ventricular ejection patterns is presented . in the system model , arterial load is described by a modified windkessel load . the ejection pattern for a given cardiac output with fixed stroke volume and duration of ejection is predicted by minimizing a criterion that describes the total ventricular o2 consumption . the ejection patterns of the model closely resemble the observed ejection patterns . also , the model predictions for changes in the values of the system parameters are qualitatively correct . the results strongly suggest that the control of ejection pattern satisfies the principle of energy cost minimization .

osteonecrosis [ editorial ] 
core decompression of the femoral head for osteonecrosis . the results of forty core-decompression procedures that were performed for ischemic necrosis of the femoral head in thirty-one patients over a four-year period were retrospectively reviewed to ascertain the effectiveness of the procedure . the data did not support the published rates of success of the procedure for stage-1 and stage-2 lesions . with a mean length of follow-up of eighteen months , 60 per cent of the hips that had a decompression prior to collapse of the femoral head demonstrated progression of the lesion and were judged to be a failure by clinical or radiographic criteria . computerized tomographic scans and magnetic resonance imaging proved to be 100 per cent sensitive for diagnosis in preoperative testing ; isotopic bone-scanning was less sensitive ( 80 per cent ) . functional intraoperative testing by the method of ficat did not provide added sensitivity or specificity to the results of the preoperative bone scan . a postoperative or intraoperative fracture occurred in four hips , for an incidence that exceeded any in previously published reports . we concluded that core decompression should be considered a relatively ineffective procedure with significant morbidity . 
rupture and displacement of the ulnar collateral ligament of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb . preoperative diagnosis . the evaluation and treatment of injuries of the ulnar collateral ligament of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb remain controversial . in a retrospective study that was done to assess our ability to determine whether displacement of the ligament ( a stener lesion ) was present , we reviewed our accumulated experience with patients who had an injury of this ligament who were treated surgically between 1972 and 1984. since our method of evaluation changed in 1977 , we compared the preoperative and operative diagnoses in the twenty patients who were treated surgically from 1972 through 1976 with those in the twenty patients who were so treated from 1977 through 1984. considering all forty patients who were treated operatively , sixteen ( 40 per cent ) had a typical stener lesion , and in two others ( 5 per cent ) the ulnar collateral ligament was rolled up on itself and lying beneath the adductor aponeurosis . from 1972 through 1976 , stability was tested with the metacarpophalangeal joint in complete extension or in varying amounts of flexion . of the twenty thumbs that were evaluated by this technique and were treated surgically , 20 per cent had a stener lesion . from 1977 through 1984 , stability was tested with the joint in full flexion because of the findings in anatomical studies that were completed in 1977 ; the incidence of a stener lesion in the twenty thumbs that were treated by repair or reattachment of the ligament during this time was 70 per cent .

adolescent idiopathic scoliosis treated by harrington-rod distraction and fusion . one hundred and thirty-three patients who had adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were treated by insertion of a single harrington distraction rod and spinal fusion . postoperative immobilization consisted of six months in a below-the-shoulder cast . the mean preoperative curve was 50 degrees , with a range of 30 to 110 degrees . the mean final curve was 35 degrees , with a range of 19 to 63 degrees . there were no neurological injuries and no deep wound infections . twelve patients required further surgery for complications , all of which were treated successfully . the duration of follow-up ranged from twenty-four to seventy-two months . at final follow-up , all patients had resumed their normal preoperative activities without limitations . 
chronic anterior-compartment syndrome of the leg . results of treatment by fasciotomy . thirty legs in nineteen patients , eleven with bilateral and eight with unilateral chronic anterior-compartment syndrome , were treated by fasciotomy . in addition , five of these patients ( six legs ) had compression of the superficial peroneal nerve : two before and three after fasciotomy . one patient also had lateral compartment syndrome in one leg . the patients who had compression of the superficial peroneal nerve were relieved by partial fasciectomy and fasciotomy of the lateral compartment . in one of these patients , with bilateral nerve compression , both superficial peroneal nerves were anomalous . the patient who had lateral compartment syndrome was relieved by fasciotomy of this compartment . two patients required a second fasciotomy due to recurrence of the chronic compartment syndrome . at an average length of follow-up of twenty-five months after fasciotomy for anterior compartment syndrome , functional capacity was unlimited or increased in eighteen patients ( twenty-eight legs ) and was unchanged in one patient ( two legs ) who had had compression of the superficial peroneal nerve . the intramuscular pressures in the anterior compartment were normal at rest as well as during and after exercise eight months after the original fasciotomy in twenty-eight legs and eight months after the second fasciotomy in two legs . 
compartment syndrome in open tibial fractures . a retrospective review of the cases of 180 patients who had 198 acute open fractures of the tibial shaft and were admitted to a multiple-trauma referral center over a three-year period revealed an incidence of accompanying compartment syndrome of 9.1 per cent ( eighteen fractures in sixteen patients ) . each of the eighteen compartment syndromes was documented by measurements of intracompartmental pressure that were obtained by the saline-injection technique , and all were treated by four-compartment fasciotomy . the incidence of compartment syndrome was found to be directly proportional to the degree of injury to soft tissue and bone ; this complication occurred most often in association with a comminuted , grade-iii open injury to a pedestrian . the physician must maintain a high index of suspicion to detect a compartment syndrome in the patient who has multiple trauma , as its clinical signs and symptoms may be masked by a closed injury of the head or the need for ventilatory support or prolonged anesthesia for other surgical procedures . 
neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord with transient quadriplegia . the purpose of this study was to define as a distinct clinical entity the syndrome of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord with transient quadriplegia . the sensory changes include burning pain , numbness , tingling , and loss of sensation , while the motor changes range from weakness to complete paralysis . the episodes are transient and complete recovery usually occurs in ten to fifteen minutes , although in some patients gradual resolution occurs over a period of thirty-six to forty-eight hours . except for burning paresthesia , pain in the neck is not present at the time of injury and there is complete return of motor function and full , pain-free motion of the cervical spine . in our series , routine roentgenograms of the cervical spine were negative for fractures or dislocations in all patients . however , the roentgenographic findings did include developmental spinal stenosis in seventeen patients , congenital fusion in five patients , cervical instability in four patients , and intervertebral disc disease in six patients . spinal stenosis was determined by two different roentgenographic methods . the first was the standard method , and the second was a ratio method devised by us . both measurements were made at the level of the third through the sixth vertebral body on a routine lateral roentgenogram of the cervical spine that was available for twenty-four of the thirty-two patients and for a control group of forty-nine male subjects of similar age who did not have any neurological complaints . using the ratio method , a measurement of less than 0.80 indicated significant spinal stenosis in the group of twenty-four patients for whom roentgenograms were available , as compared with a ratio of approximately 1.00 or more in the control group . there was statistically significant spinal stenosis ( p less than 0.0001 ) in all of the patients as compared with the control subjects by both methods of determining spinal stenosis . a survey of 503 schools participating in national collegiate athletic association ( ncaa ) football in the 1984 season found that 1.3 per 10 , 000 athletes had a history that was suggestive of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord . the phenomenon of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord occurs in individuals with developmental stenosis of the cervical spine , congenital fusion , cervical instability , or protrusion of an intervertebral disc in association with a decrease in the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal . we postulate that in athletes with diminution of the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal the spinal cord can , on forced hyperextension or hyperflexion , be compressed , causing transitory motor and sensory manifestations .

congenital cervical stenosis presenting as transient quadriplegia in athletes . report of two cases . the cases of two patients in whom complete but transient quadriplegia developed after an injury that was incurred while playing football are presented . both patients were found to have a congenitally narrow cervical vertebral canal . critical stenosis resulting in the transient quadriplegia occurred after a presumed injury to a cervical disc . in our opinion , a myelogram should be made for patients with a history of transient quadriplegia , numbness , or a burning sensation down the back or the lower extremities , even if other radiographic studies are interpreted as negative . patients who have stenosis of the cervical spine should be advised to discontinue participation in contact sports . 
skeletal suspension in the management of severe burns in children . a sixteen-year experience . from 1966 to 1983 , skeletal suspension was used at the shriners burns institute , galveston , texas , for the treatment of 626 burned pediatric patients who had 1128 affected extremities . skeletal suspension was used for 863 acutely burned extremities ( 76.5 per cent ) to facilitate skin-grafting and in 265 extremities ( 23.5 per cent ) for functional positioning in the surgical correction of burn-acquired deformities . in a retrospective examination of these patients , there were fifty complications ( 4.4 per cent ) related to the skeletal suspension , of which forty-five ( 4.0 per cent ) were infections . all infections resolved with removal of the pins or the administration of antibiotics , or both . with this established low rate of complications , skeletal suspension continues to be a useful adjunct in the care of the severely burned pediatric patient . 
osteomyelitis in gaucher disease . a relatively common complication of gaucher disease , the so-called crisis , frequently is difficult to differentiate from acute osteomyelitis . we reviewed the cases of forty-nine patients with gaucher disease who were treated at the massachusetts general hospital and found that eleven patients had required admission to the hospital for an acute symptom complex that represented either a crisis or an infection . five of the patients proved to have acute hematogenous osteomyelitis . the delayed diagnosis of the infection in three of the patients with osteomyelitis led to an unsatisfactory outcome . 
the contributions of dietary protein and mineral to the healing of experimental fractures . a biomechanical study . we examined the contributions of dietary protein and mineral to fracture-healing by assessing the mechanical properties of fracture callus in rats that were fed a diet that was deficient in or enriched by these nutrients . in order to isolate the effects of diet on fracture-healing , we developed a method for producing a standard closed femoral fracture with minimum-soft-tissue injury . three groups of animals were studied . group i was a control group , in which the rats did not undergo an operation . the rats in group ii underwent intramedullary pinning of the right femur , but no fracture was created . the rats in group iii underwent pinning identical to that used for group ii , after which a closed , transverse femoral fracture was produced . immediately after surgery , the animals in each group were subdivided into five diet-treatment subgroups . subgroup a received a regular diet ; subgroup b received a protein-free diet ; and subgroup c received a mineral-free diet that was lacking in calcium , phosphorus , and vitamin d . subgroup d received a protein-supplemented diet that was composed of three times the calculated requirement of protein , and subgroup e received a mineral-supplemented diet that was composed of three times the calculated requirements of calcium and phosphorus as well as a therapeutic dose of vitamin d , equivalent to that used in the treatment of osteomalacia . at the end of five weeks , the animals were killed and the right femur of each one was subjected to torsion-testing to failure .

a comparative study of porous coatings in a weight-bearing total hip-arthroplasty model . the purposes of this study were to compare ingrowth of bone into three types of porous coating and to determine the effect of the type of porous coating and the degree of coverage of the stem on the remodeling of bone on the femoral side in cementless hip arthroplasty . a left total hip arthroplasty was performed in forty dogs . thirty of the dogs had a titanium-alloy femoral prosthesis that had had one of three types of commercially pure titanium porous material applied along the length of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stem : ten with sintered fiber-metal , ten with sintered beads , and ten with plasma flame-spray coating . the remaining ten dogs had a femoral component that was circumferentially coated with commercially pure titanium that was plasma flame-sprayed along the length of the stem . in each group , five animals were killed at one month and five were killed at six months . ingrowth of bone into all three types of porous coating was observed , indicating secure fixation of all components . by six months , there was more ingrowth of bone and new medullary bone adjacent to the proximal and distal aspects of the stems compared with the middle level of the stems in all groups . no significant difference in ingrowth of bone was observed in the beaded surface ( 25.2 per cent ) and the fiber-metal surface ( 16.6 per cent ) at one month , but at six months there was significantly less ingrowth into the beaded surface ( 23.3 per cent ) than into the fiber-metal surface ( 37.3 per cent ) . in all groups , a proximal-to-distal gradient of loss of cortical bone was observed by six months . the group of dogs that had the stem with the circumferential coating experienced more severe loss of bone than did the three groups that had a stem with a partial coating . the magnitude of loss of bone was dependent on the extent rather than the type of porous coating . 
the three-part fracture of the proximal part of the humerus . operative treatment . a retrospective review of the cases of fifteen patients with a three-part fracture of the proximal part of the humerus is presented . fourteen of the fractures were treated with tension-band wiring and one , with an ao buttress plate . the patients were evaluated for pain , range of motion , strength , and function of the involved shoulder and the radiographic result at an average of fifty-four months after the injury . at follow-up , the shoulders had an average of 126 degrees of active elevation , 29 degrees of active external rotation , 81 degrees of active abduction , and internal rotation to the second lumbar vertebra . the only early complication was failure of fixation in the patient who had been treated with a buttress plate . in two patients , radiographic evidence of avascular necrosis of the humeral head later developed , and one of them required revision to a hemiarthroplasty . in conclusion , we recommend operative treatment for the healthy , active individual who has a three-part fracture of the proximal part of the humerus . we found that the best results with these difficult fractures are obtained using tension-band wiring . 
survivorship analysis of total hip replacements . results in a series of active patients who were less than fifty-five years old . between 1971 and 1980 , the senior one of us ( c.s.r. ) performed 101 primary total hip replacements in eighty-five consecutive patients who were less than fifty-five years old . all of the patients had degenerative joint disease . survivorship analysis was used to calculate a predicted cumulative rate of success for this series of total hip replacements over ten years of follow-up . this method of analysis of the data was chosen because it provides a prediction of the expected durability of a total hip arthroplasty in any individual patient . the need for revision because of loosening or infection or else radiographic evidence of migration of a component was the criterion for failure . two revisions were performed for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component . one infection necessitated revision , and radiographic evidence of loss of fixation was seen in one additional acetabular component and one femoral stem . life-table calculations predicted that the survivorship of all of the total hip replacements in this series would be 87.6 per cent at ten years of follow-up . based on the results of the application of this method of analysis to the current series , we concluded that a primary cemented total hip replacement , when performed for coxarthrosis , can be expected to function durably in an active middle-aged patient . 
urinary retention in men after total hip arthroplasty . a prospective study of sixty-four men was conducted before they underwent a total hip arthroplasty to try to identify the factors that are predictive of postoperative urinary retention . although neither the urological history nor the physical examination provided information that was helpful in accurately identifying the patients who were at risk , those whose peak urinary flow rate was less than seventeen milliliters per second did have a statistically significant likelihood of the development of urinary retention . a system of management that we hope will reduce the incidence of this complication is proposed .

early diagnosis of atlanto-axial rotatory fixation . atlanto-axial rotatory fixation is one of a spectrum of rotatory abnormalities of the atlanto-axial joint . rotatory fixation without anterior displacement of the atlas ( type i ) has been reported in only a few cases in which there has been a prolonged interval between injury and diagnosis . the majority of these cases eventually required cervical fusion for persistent deformity or instability . two cases are presented in which this diagnosis was made early with the aid of rotated odontoid radiographs , tomography and computerised axial tomography . treatment by a short period of halter traction achieved reduction and early return of function . the authors conclude that early recognition and treatment of this rare condition may prevent the subsequent deformity and instability for which cervical fusion has been required . 
hangman 's fracture in an infant . a case is reported of fracture of the pedicles of the axis vertebra in an infant . non-operative management in a minerva cast resulted in union and full recovery without complications .

a reappraisal of acute traumatic central cord syndrome . a review of 77 patients with traumatic central cord syndrome revealed that atypical variations are more common than the existing literature suggests and that these may be seen in a wide variety of acute injuries to the cervical spine . in general the outcome is good ; a favourable prognosis on admission is suggested by good hand function , hyperpathia , lhermitte 's sign and normal perianal sensation . the study has highlighted the value of regular muscle charting and has cast doubt on previous neuroanatomical assumptions about the syndrome . 
vibratory response in idiopathic scoliosis . recent clinical studies have suggested that a neurological lesion may be a cause of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and animal experiments have implicated the posterior column pathway . we have tried to determine if differences in neurological response could be detected and measured clinically , and have compared the threshold of detection of vibratory sensation in 20 girls with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with that in 20 clinically normal age-matched controls . a highly significant reduction of the threshold of detection of vibration was seen in the scoliotic group compared to the controls ( p less than 0.001 ) . curve magnitude did not correlate with this threshold for either the upper ( r = 0.172 ) or lower extremity ( r = 0.126 ) . significant asymmetry between right- and left-sided thresholds to vibration was demonstrated in the scoliotic group . our study supports the concept that an aberration in the function of the posterior column pathway of the cord may be of primary importance in the aetiology of idiopathic scoliosis . a clinically practical test to measure this function is presented . 
the changes in the intervertebral disc after chemonucleolysis demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the spine produces images which reflect the chemical composition of the intervertebral disc . we have conducted a prospective study of the serial changes in the mri appearance of the intervertebral disc after chemonucleolysis with the enzyme chymopapain . fourteen patients were studied after single-level chemonucleolysis and the results compared with a control group of 17 discs in six patients who had diagnostic discography without enzyme insertion . a consistent pattern of gradual loss of signal from the nucleus pulposus culminating in complete loss of nuclear signal was seen in all cases after chemonucleolysis . chymopapain therefore produced mri changes analogous with premature gross disc degeneration . the rate at which this occurred varied ; complete loss of signal took at least six weeks . transitory minor end-plate changes were present in five patients , probably representing a mild chemical discitis . no similar changes were seen in the discography group . 
observations on the growth of the adolescent spine . we have measured the increase in height and width of the vertebral bodies and expressed them as percentages of the total growth in children aged 10 to 17 years . the first group , 10 boys and 10 girls , each had a single thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis while the second group , 10 girls , each had a single lumbar adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . no significant differences were found between the growth increments and spinal dimensions of the vertebral bodies involved in the scoliotic curve and those vertebrae outside the curve in the same patient . the vertebrae were more slender in girls than in boys . 
the role of computerised tomography in intervertebral disc prolapse . computerised tomography of the lumbar spine was performed on 22 patients with clinical evidence of prolapse of an intervertebral disc and normal or equivocal radiculograms . of 11 patients with positive scans who had an operation the presence of pathology was confirmed in 10. although ct scanning is always helpful in diagnosing disc disorders , where facilities are scarce ( as in great britain ) it is best employed in patients with negative or non-contributory radiculography . 
computerised axial tomography in traction injuries of the brachial plexus . severe traction injuries may damage the brachial plexus at any level from the spinal cord to the axillary outlet . investigation aims to determine the level of the injury for each of the nerves , trunks or cords , with particular reference to obtaining firm evidence of any intradural ( pre-ganglionic ) damage . we report the results of computerised axial tomography of the cervical spine in comparison with conventional myelography and with surgical exploration of the plexus . ct scanning with contrast enhancement greatly improves diagnostic accuracy , particularly at c5 and c6 root levels . 
reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by allogeneic tendon graft . an operation for chronic ligamentous insufficiency . we describe the use of allogeneic human tendon as an intra-articular replacement for the anterior cruciate ligament . depending on the type and degree of functional instability we recommend the addition , in some cases , of supplementary extra-articular procedures . we have reviewed 31 patients at least two years after operation and have found that 30 of them had been able to return to full sporting activities . the indications for operation and the techniques are discussed and the use of allogeneic tendon is recommended . 
isolated avulsion of the tibial attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament in childhood . 
angulation of the radius in children 's fractures . a study of 79 children with malunion of forearm fractures is presented . age at the time of injury , the site of the fracture and the degree and direction of angulation at union were correlated with loss of forearm rotation at review 3.5 to 6 years later . some guidelines are proposed for the acceptability of angular deformity at union , importance being placed on the avoidance of radial deviation of the radius , and the maintenance of the interosseous gap between the shafts of the radius and ulna . 
supracondylar fractures of the humerus . assessment of cubitus varus by the baumann angle . a simple method of radiological assessment has been used to measure the angle between the long axis of the humeral shaft and the growth plate of the capitellum ( the baumann angle ) . in the normal arm a significant relationship was found between the baumann angle and the carrying angle . the baumann angle was also measured after reduction of supracondylar fractures of the humerus and was found to correlate well with the final carrying angle measured at follow-up . there was no significant difference between the baumann angle after reduction and that measured at follow-up ; and it is suggested that this angle after reduction can be reliably used to predict accurately the final carrying angle . 
acute carpal tunnel syndrome . complications of delayed decompression . five patients suffered injuries around the wrist complicated by acute tunnel syndrome . pain associated with median nerve paraesthesia or hypo-aesthesia are indications for urgent treatment ; in four patients where operation was delayed , the outcome was poor . 
biomechanical aspects of femoral fractures in automobile accidents . a medical and engineering study was made of 1074 car accidents involving 2520 vehicle occupants . the injuries they sustained were correlated with details of the crash and with contact points inside the cars . where possible the forces which were generated in the crash were estimated and related to the injuries . in all , 39 car occupants suffered femoral shaft fracture , with an incidence of 1.7 % and 0.8 % for front and rear seat occupants respectively . of these , 31 had associated injuries to other regions of the body ; these were the cause of 13 of the 14 deaths in this group . associated injuries were more severe in car occupants who were not wearing seat belts but the incidence of femoral fracture was not significantly different . the mean velocity change ( delta-v ) causing femoral fracture was 26 mph ( 42 km / h ) and there was a higher incidence of femoral shaft fracture when delta-v was over 30 mph . estimates of forces needed to cause fracture were higher than those found in cadaver studies . the time to union of femoral fractures did not correlate with the severity of the crash but was longer ( mean 19 weeks ) than the average for other femoral fractures . 
hemitransplantation of the tendo calcaneus in children with spinal neurological disorders . in paralytic lesions in which the triceps surae is the only active muscle in the leg , elongation or division of the tendo calcaneus alone may not be enough to prevent recurrence of equinus deformity . in 10 patients ( 13 limbs ) with this pattern of muscle activity , equinus deformity was treated by hemitransplantation of the tendo calcaneus . at follow-up , which was beyond the end of growth in seven limbs , there was no recurrence of deformity in nine . in three of the four failures , a technical fault may have caused loss of activity in the transplanted part of the tendon . the two-stage operation described is recommended in the management of this pattern of paralytic deformity . 
mechanical loosening of total hip prostheses . a radiographic and roentgen stereophotogrammetric study . twenty patients were examined by standard radiography and roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis ( rsa ) during a two-year period after total hip arthroplasty . eleven of the acetabular components migrated cranially and three femoral components migrated distally . this migration was most rapid during the first four months after operation . our findings support the possibility that mechanical loosening is initiated by thermal injury during polymerisation of the cement ; the less frequent migration of the metallic femoral component compared with the polyethylene acetabular component may be because the metal acts as a heat sink . standard radiographs were inadequate for assessment of early mechanical loosening , whereas rsa could reveal migration within four months of the arthroplasty . 
a simple technique for arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint . 
the robert jones bandage . a bulky compression dressing ( the robert jones bandage ) is often used by orthopaedic surgeons . we have reviewed its history and monitored intramuscular compartment pressure under it after total knee replacement . we found that it increased compartment pressure and helped to reduce bleeding , tissue oedema and the size of effusions and haemarthroses . 
spontaneous regression of a desmoid tumour . a 15-year-old girl presented with a very large desmoid tumour in her buttock ; it extended into the pelvis and thigh and would have required hindquarter amputation for its removal . this was not performed and the tumour underwent spontaneous regression . fourteen years later the patient is alive and well . the suggestion is made that in some cases a more expectant approach to treatment might be justified for what is essentially a non-malignant condition . 
dome osteotomy of the tibia for osteoarthritis of the knee . proximal tibial osteotomy is commonly performed for osteoarthritis of the knee with deformity . the results of 105 dome osteotomies have been reviewed at a minimum follow-up of one year and an average of 4.8 years . before operation all the knees were painful , 50.5 % severely ; a further 45.7 % disturbed sleep at night . at review 15.2 % of knees were free of pain and 60 % had only slight pain which did not restrict activity . the preoperative range of movement was maintained and there was only a slight tendency for radiological changes to progress , with actual improvement in some cases . no correlation was found between the correction of deformity to physiological valgus and the result . we cannot explain why tibial osteotomy produces such useful and sustained pain relief . 
st georg modular knee prosthesis . a two-and-a-half to six-year follow-up . the st georg modular knee replacement has been studied in 59 cases with an observation period ranging from 28 to 73 months . in 47 % of the knees both compartments were replaced ; five of the six poor results were in this group . these were revised to a hinge arthroplasty or , in one case , to an arthrodesis . other complications were few and insignificant . there were no infections . we concluded that unicompartmental knee arthroplasty can be recommended when joint involvement is localised to one compartment only . with more generalised joint disease we prefer a semiconstrained total condylar prosthesis . 
management of rachitic deformities in children with chronic renal failure . five children with chronic renal failure and severe rachitic deformities of the lower limbs were treated with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin d ( 1 alpha-ohd3 ) for 16 to 53 months . there was symptomatic , biochemical and radiological improvement in all five children and operative correction of their deformities was not needed . we recommend a trial of treatment with 1 alpha-ohd3 for this condition before surgical procedures . 
survival of knee arthroplasties . a nation-wide multicentre investigation of 8000 cases . a prospective nation-wide study of knee arthroplasty has been under way in sweden since october 1975. by the end of 1983 , 4505 arthroplasties for osteoarthritis and 3495 for rheumatoid arthritis had been recorded and reviewed one , three and six years after the operation . using actuarial methods , the probability of the prosthesis remaining in situ after six years was calculated . in osteoarthritis this probability ranged from 65 % for hinged prostheses to 90 % for medial compartment prostheses . two-and three-compartment prostheses produced intermediate results with 87 % survival . in rheumatoid arthritis the probability varied from 72 % for medial compartment prostheses to 90 % for two- and three-compartment prostheses . the main reason for failure was loosening of the components , the second most common was infection . the probability of revision for infection by six years was 2 % in osteoarthritis and 3 % in rheumatoid arthritis . most revisions were to a three-compartment prosthesis . knee fusion at primary revision was required in 2 % of the cases at six years . 
the osteocutaneous free fibular graft . free osteocutaneous fibular grafts , revascularised by microvascular anastomoses , have been used for one-stage reconstruction of extensive bone and skin loss in the lower leg in seven patients . the addition of an integral skin flap to a vascularised fibular graft makes reconstruction of bone defects with significant skin loss possible , and the technique for designing and raising such a flap is presented . the advantages of this transfer over other microvascular osteocutaneous flaps are the available length of straight cortical bone , the large thin skin flap , the good diameter of the vascular pedicle and the fact that dissection is carried out under a tourniquet . 
transient synovitis and perthes ' disease . is there an aetiological connection ? a prospective study was made of 119 children with transient synovitis or any other cause for synovial effusion and elevated intra-articular pressure . during a follow-up of one year not one case of perthes ' disease was diagnosed and the late clinical and radiographic changes were minimal with moderate overgrowth of the femoral head in 33 % and widening of the joint space in 14.2 % . our results do not support the widely accepted concept that perthes ' disease develops as a result of the period of elevated intra-articular pressure found in transient synovitis . further research into this and perthes ' disease should follow the premise that they are two different diseases without any aetiological connection . 
anterior midline or medial parapatellar incision for arthroplasty of the knee . a comparative study . early mobilisation after arthroplasty of the knee sometimes results in wound breakdown . the two commonly used incisions , the anterior midline and the medial parapatellar incisions , were compared in order to determine which had the best potential for wound healing . study of the cleavage lines around the knee demonstrated that the medial parapatellar incision lies parallel to the lines , whilst the anterior midline incision lies perpendicular to them . in addition , the medial parapatellar wound was found to be subjected to significantly less tension during flexion ; after arthroplasty it can be expected to heal faster and to be less liable to disruption during early mobilisation . 
repeat compartment decompression with partial fasciectomy . after having had a standard decompression for anterior compartment syndrome , five patients presented with persistent symptoms and pressure values above normal . a repeat procedure combined with fasciectomy relieved their pain ; postoperative pressure values were normal . 
exercise pain in the lower leg . chronic compartment syndrome and medial tibial syndrome . the aetiology of pain in the lower leg during exercise has been studied in 110 athletes by monitoring intracompartmental pressure during exercise and by technetium bone scans . patients were assigned to three diagnostic groups : chronic compartment syndrome , medial tibial syndrome and those with non-specific findings . our results indicate that subcutaneous fasciotomy of the affected compartment ( s ) is the treatment of choice for chronic compartment syndrome . the treatment of patients with medial tibial syndrome , either by operation or conservatively , has been unsuccessful ; non-specific symptoms have been treated conservatively with success . 
epithelioid sarcoma in association with total knee replacement . a case report . a case is reported in which an epithelioid sarcoma developed in an apparently benign enchondroma or bone infarct at the site of a chrome-cobalt total knee replacement . 
congenital aplasia of the cruciate ligaments . a report of six cases . instability of the knee is frequently found in association with congenital leg-length discrepancy . we have studied six such patients clinically , radiologically and arthroscopically . clinical signs of knee instability and significant radiological changes were present in all , and at arthroscopy the anterior cruciate ligament was completely absent in four patients and functionless in the other two . this deficiency appears to be a congenital condition which may predispose to meniscus injury or retropatellar pain ; it may also lead to subluxation or dislocation of the knee during leg-lengthening procedures . 
regeneration of the sciatic nerve in rats . the effect of muscle basement membrane . an orientated substratum has been implicated in the development and regeneration of axons and synapses . we prepared a basement membrane matrix from autogenous striated muscle , used it to repair the sciatic nerve in rats , then investigated the results by histology and electrophysiology . when treated grafts were coaxially aligned with the nerve fascicles functional recovery appeared within 30 days , with good growth of axons into the distal nerve . grafts with myotubes at right angles to the nerve fascicles supported nerve regeneration but at a slower rate . grafts of coaxially aligned but untreated muscle allowed axon penetration only through naturally degenerated muscle fibres , with minimal axon penetration of the distal nerve . it is concluded that in the rat a treated graft with correctly orientated empty myotubes can facilitate and guide the regeneration of peripheral nerve after injury and so lead to recolonisation of the distal stump with functional recovery . 
genesis of the ball-and-socket ankle . ball-and-socket ankle is a rare deformity associated with such pre-existing conditions as congenital shortening of the lower limb , coalition of tarsal bones , absent digital rays and aplasia or hypoplasia of the fibula . we have observed seven patients with this deformity for an average of six years from initial examination at 20 days to 3.5 years . arthrography showed that the configuration of the ankle was apparently normal in patients under 10 months of age and that a ball-and-socket joint develops by four to five years of age , possibly in compensation for the loss of inversion and eversion caused by tarsal coalition . ball-and-socket joint is therefore probably not congenital , but is an acquired deformity secondary to various pre-existing congenital conditions .

surgical management of intracavitary cardiac tumors . a review of fifteen patients and current status in japan . fifteen patients with intracavitary cardiac tumors were operated on at the kobe university hospital between september 1977 and january 1984. three of the patients were men and twelve were women . they ranged in age from 9 to 75 years . their symptoms were chest pain , dyspnea , cough , palpitation and syncope . definite diagnosis was confirmed by echo- and cineangiocardiography . there were 14 benign tumors consisting of 13 myxomas , one leiomyoma and one malignant myxosarcoma . the left atrium was the most common chamber involved ( 12 instances ) , followed by the right atrium ( 3 ) . surgery was performed in all cases under cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia and cold crystalloid cardioplegia . tumors were removed en bloc at the base with their attachment to the atrial septum or free wall in all cases . three patients underwent concomitant mitral annuloplasty or mitral commissurotomy . two cases with left atrial myxoma died postoperatively : one case associated with mitral annuloplasty died of congestive heart failure due to newly developed chordal rupture two months after surgery , and the other died of congestive heart failure 13 months after the first operation . re-excision for recurrence of the myxosarcoma in the left atrium was performed in the latter case as a second surgical procedure . the remaining 13 cases with benign tumors are doing well and are without recurrence . from these favorable results , surgical intervention should be recommended prior to the occurrence of heart failure and severe complications such as coronary or peripheral embolism whenever cardiac tumors are detected by non-invasive echocardiography and cineangiocardiography . 
reduction of blood use in surgery for coronary artery disease . ninety consecutive patients underwent surgery for coronary artery disease . eighty-one ( 90 % ) did not require blood transfusion in the immediate postoperative period ; nine patients received 16 units of blood , 6 of whom bled excessively ; 2 were re-explored . twelve had post-operative haemoglobins below 8.5 g / dl during their stay . they were transfused a total of 28 units of blood before discharge . post-operative blood loss in the 9 transfused early averaged 894 + / - 176 ml ( sem ) . loss from the not transfused patients averaged 481 + / - 18 ml ( p less than 0.001 ) . patients transfused later had a mean loss of 510 + / - 36 ml ( p ns ) . sixty-nine patients were not transfused . haemoglobin on the first post-operative day was 11.3 + / - 1.3 g / dl ( sd ) . this declined to 10.2 + / - 1.2 g / dl on the fifth day . discharge haemoglobin was 10.5 + / - 1.2 g / dl . two patients died , one of myocardial infarction on the third day and the other of pancreatitis on the fourth . both had had early blood transfusion . haemoglobins were above 10 g / dl . of the 69 untransfused patients 17 % had supraventricular arrhythmias . ten percent had serous wound discharges ; 3 were infected . there were no sternal dehiscences . it is concluded that bank blood transfusion with its attendant hazards and expense is easily avoidable in most patients . this saving of resources will increase the availability of blood and rare groups for surgery . 
pulmonary embolism from a parasitic cardiac clot secondary to hepatic alveolar echinococcosis . an exceptional form of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis with metastasis of the right atrium is reported . this cardiac location of the parasitosis was revealed by attacks of pulmonary embolism which produced secondary pulmonary lesions . this case suggests that pulmonary metastases of alveolar echinococcosis of the liver might be due to the migration of parasitic clots from the hepatic veins . 
myxoma of the aortic valve in a child . myxomas are predominantly located in the right on left atrium . we report an unusual case of a myxoma adherent to the aortic valve . the child presented with symptoms of subaortic stenosis . by invasive methods a tumor was diagnosed located at the aortic valve . after surgical removal the child recovered soon and is doing well . according to our knowledge this is the first report of a myxoma of the aortic valve . 
bjork-shiley valve malfunction by prolapsed sutures . severe aortic regurgitation developed in three patients after aortic valve replacement within six months due to long sutures prolapsing across the " annulus " of bjork-shiley prosthesis . at reoperation the offending sutures were trimmed or tucked back to the aortic wall to eliminate aortic regurgitation . prolapse of unravelled knots may be the likely cause . everting the sewing skirt during the first replacement may prevent this complication . 
traumatic vascular lesions associated with fractures and dislocations . from may 1977 to january 1983 , 270 patients with traumatic vascular lesions were treated in our service . among these , 27 presented associated fractures and / or dislocations . a high index of suspicion , the early recognition of the presence of vascular injury by thorough clinical evaluation , routine use of the doppler flowmeter and broad indication of preoperative angiography resulted in prompt repair of these lesions in the majority of cases . early exploration , wide fasciotomies , use of temporary intraluminal shunts during the bone fixation procedures ( usually by internal plates ) , definitive venous and arterial repair after limb stabilization was achieved and frequent use of intraoperative angiography were the predominant factors in the treatment and outcome in these complex injuries . all eight limbs with closed fractures and / or dislocations were preserved , as well as 17 of 19 ( 89 % ) of the limbs with open or exposed skeletal injuries , resulting in a limb salvage rate of 92.6 % . 
reconstruction with insertion of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene ( eptfe ) for iliac venous obstruction . surgical therapy for dvt in the legs , including reconstruction of the blood circulation system and thrombectomy with a fogarty catheter , is not always satisfactory , as indicated by the variety of opinions both for and against them . however , it is also a fact that postphlebitic syndrome can result from incomplete treatment . therefore , surgical approaches should by given priority in the acute stage of the disease . in 5 patients who showed either complete obstruction or insufficient removal of thrombi from the proximal region in leg dvt , we performed crossover femoro-femoral bypass using eptfe ( including two wire reinforced grafts ) and were able to obtain good long-term patency over periods of 8-18 months . 
the significance of tibial artery disease in the management of popliteal aneurysms . the clinical , radiographic and histologic features of sixty-one popliteal aneurysms in 36 patients are reviewed . twenty-seven aneurysms were thrombosed and presented with an acutely ischaemic limb or the sudden onset of severe claudication . thirty-four patent aneurysms presented with either ischaemic ulceration or claudication due to tibial artery disease or were asymptomatic with normal distal pulses . thrombosis made reconstruction difficult and at times required a femoro-tibial graft . in others reconstruction was not possible leading to amputation either as primary treatment or following failed revascularization . in patent aneurysms one or more tibial arteries were frequently occluded . it is postulated that obliterative atheromatous disease of the tibial vessels and the slow flow through the aneurysmal vessels is responsible for the high incidence of thrombosis , poor graft patency and a high amputation rate . 
our eight-year experience with human umbilical vein grafts . from 1977 through 1984 , 58 arterial reconstructions using glutaraldehyde-tanned human umbilical vein ( h.u.v. ) grafts were carried out : 41 femoropopliteal , 4 composite aortopopliteal ( a dacron graft was inserted proximally ) , 5 femorotibial , 6 axillofemoral , 1 femorofemoral , and 1 iliofemoral bypass . autogenous saphenous vein was absent or inadequate in all patients . limb salvage was the primary indication for surgery ( 89.7 % ) . five and 8 years cumulative patency rates were 42.8 % and 35.1 % respectively for all h.u.v. by-passes and 52.4 % and 41.9 % respectively for femoropopliteal by-passes . four out of the 5 femorotibial by-passes failed during the first month following surgery . two of the 6 axillofemoral and 3 of the 4 composite aortopopliteal by-passes thrombosed within 1 and 3 years after surgery , respectively . perioperative mortality was 5.1 % , while overall mortality was 17.2 % . the following conclusions can be drawn from these results : h.u.v. grafts did not achieve cumulative patency rates superior to those reported with autogenous saphenous vein , in limb salvage situations , when the saphenous vein is not available , the h.u.v. graft offers acceptable salvage rates , results from the 8-year follow-up period demonstrate the durability and long-term patency of h.u.v. grafts . 
renal function following aneurysmectomy of the abdominal aorta . postoperative renal function was evaluated in 90 patients operated on for abdominal aortic aneurysms . forty-four patients were operated on acutely because of impending or actual rupture of the aneurysm . forty-six patients were operated on electively . the overall mortality rate was 23.7 % with a post-operative mortality of 7.8 % . postoperative renal function was evaluated by measurements of the s-creatinine . impaired renal function was found postoperatively in 45 % of the surviving patients . forty percent of the patients operated on electively had postoperative renal impairment compared with 52 % of the patients operated on acutely . the postoperative mortality rate in patients with impaired renal function was 32.4 % compared with 8.7 % in patients with unchanged renal function . no significant relation between postoperative renal impairment and administration of aminoglycosides , duration of the operation or clamping time of the aorta was found . we found a significant relationship between postoperative renal impairment and episodes of hypotension ( p less than 0.01 ) and the volume of blood transfusions needed ( p less than 0.001 ) . 
differentiation of ruptured aortic aneurysm from acute expansion by computerised tomography . ct scans were obtained in five patients who presented with abdominal pain and were found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm without evidence of hypovolaemia . a periaortic haematoma and evidence of a rupture was found on scanning in three of the patients and confirmed at immediate operation . a retrospective diagnosis of rapidly expanding ( acute ) aneurysm was made in the other two patients in whom no other pathology was found at early elective operation . ct scanning is useful in differentiating small well-controlled ruptures from rapidly expanding aneurysms . 
" chronic-contained " ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm : is it real ? rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is readily diagnosed when the triad of abdominal or back pain , shock and a pulsatile abdominal mass are present . clinical diagnosis can be difficult , however , when patients present with chronic pain and an aneurysm which is not readily palpable . in these patients with confusing abdominal symptoms , ct scan provides a rapid , noninvasive diagnosis . the acute leaking aaa has been documented , but only rarely . this report identifies two patients who ruptured an aortic aneurysm several " months " prior to operation--a " contained chronic " rupture . 
routine angiography for abdominal aortic aneurysm : the case for informed operative selection . an ongoing prospective protocol of routine abdominal aortic angiography in the evaluation of patients presenting for elective abdominal aortic aneurysmorrhaphy was assessed for its efficacy in directing perioperative management . eighteen per cent of 70 angiograms provided decisive information , and an additional 14 % were potentially helpful in operative management ; we therefore feel that routine angiography is a valuable part of the preoperative workup of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms . 
external iliac artery occlusion by bicycle handle injury . blunt injury in a youth to the external iliac artery with secondary thrombosis , associated clinically with a seemingly minor blunt injury to the right lower quadrant of the abdomen , is presented . symptoms were delayed , but eventually became dramatic . the methods of diagnosis and evaluation are discussed and the selection of the operative procedure is outlined . the potential of significant vascular injury should be suspected and followed closely in all blunt injuries in the proximity of major vascular conduits . early and aggressive treatment in the young is mandatory to prevent not only the usual complications of limb ischemia , but the discrepant limb lengths seen in the growing youth deprived of normal circulation to an extremity . 
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy associated with thromboexclusion for dissecting aortic aneurysm . disseminated intravascular coagulopathy ( dic ) was demonstrated in a patient who underwent surgical thromboexclusion by blood flow reversal for dissecting aortic aneurysm . large clots in the descending thoracic aorta and extra-anatomic bypass grafting might have been causative factors of the consumption coagulopathy . low-dose heparin together with fresh-frozen plasma was effective ; however , extreme caution should be adopted with such patients to minimize the development of dic , because the factors responsible for the coagulation abnormalities are not removed in patients who undergo the surgical treatment of thromboexclusion . 
internal mammary artery to pulmonary artery fistula . a rare case of arteriovenous fistula between an internal mammary artery and a pulmonary artery is presented . the clinical history of recurrent bronchitis and dyspnoea during exercise , the presence of right parasternal murmur with normal heart size and normal blood gases justified the execution of an arteriovenous thoracic angiography which revealed the presence of a cirsoid aneurysm supplied by the internal and external mammary arteries . diagnostic investigation and surgical indication in patients with the rare fistulous communication between the internal mammary artery and the systemic or pulmonary circulation are analysed . 
the impossible intubation--what next ? a patient is presented in whom endotracheal intubation was impossible secondary to an obstructing substernal goiter and laryngeal spasm . cardiopulmonary bypass was utilized to provide safe induction of anesthesia and intubation so that the substernal goiter could be removed . other alternative methods in anesthetic management are discussed . 
alterations in calcium , vitamin d , and parathyroid hormone physiology in normal men with aging : relationship to the development of senile osteopenia . the effects of aging on calcium and bone metabolism have not been systematically examined in men . to identify age-related alterations in vitamin d and pth physiology and to assess their impact on skeletal health , we studied 62 normal men , aged 30-92 yr . the men were in excellent health , and none had any evidence of metabolic bone disease and / or known risk factors for osteopenia . serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d ( 25ohd ) concentrations declined steadily with advancing age ( r = -0.47 ; p less than 0.001 ) , and there was a corresponding decline in serum 24 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d [ 24 , 25- ( oh ) 2d ] levels ( r = -0.41 ; p less than 0.001 ) . serum 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d concentrations , however , did not vary over this age range ( r = -0.07 ; p = ns ) . plasma pth levels increased with aging ( r = -0.24 ; p less than 0.001 ) , and there was a concomitant increase in urinary camp excretion ( r = 0.38 ; p less than 0.001 ) . renal function ( creatinine clearance ) clearly declined with increasing age ( r = -0.71 ; p less than 0.001 ) . in conjunction with these changes in calcium metabolism , radial and vertebral bone mineral content declined . whereas the fall in radial bone mineral content ( single photon absorptiometry ) at both proximal and distal sites was slight , there was a marked decrease in vertebral bone mineral content , as measured by quantitative computed tomography ( r = -0.72 ; p less than 0.0001 ) . the fall in vertebral bone mineral content correlated well with the declines in serum 25ohd and 24 , 25- ( oh ) 2d concentrations ( r = 0.47 ; p less than 0.001 and r = 0.51 ; p less than 0.001 , respectively ) and with the decline in renal function ( r = 0.46 ; p less than 0.001 ) . multiple regression analysis revealed that the effects of aging on bone mineral content could be accounted for in large part by concomitant changes in mineral metabolism . both the decline in renal function and the fall in serum 24 , 25- ( oh ) 2d levels were closely associated with the fall in bone mineral content . these results indicate that a decline in renal function and alterations in vitamin d metabolism occur with aging in normal men . these changes contribute to , if not cause , the associated decline in skeletal mineral content in aging men . 
serum levels of somatomedins and somatomedin-binding protein in pregnant women with type i or gestational diabetes and their infants . the serum levels of the low mol wt form of somatomedin-binding protein ( smbp ) were 5-fold higher in both diabetic ( n = 44 ) and nondiabetic pregnant women ( n = 14 ) than in nonpregnant women . no difference was found between women with type 1 diabetes and those with gestational diabetes . there was a negative correlation between maternal levels of smbp during the last trimester and the birth weight percentile of the infants ( r = -0.51 ) . there was a 2- to 3-fold elevation of maternal insulin-like growth factor ( igf-i ) levels during pregnancy in both diabetic and nondiabetic women . a positive correlation ( r = 0.49 ) was found between maternal igf-i levels and the birth weight percentiles of their infants . the correlation between the ratio of igf-i to smbp , which may reflect the igf-i available to the placenta , to birth weight percentile was higher ( r = 0.57 ) , and the se of estimate of weight percentile was 23 % . the ratio between igf-i and smbp in cord blood was correlated with birth weight , although cord blood igf-i and smbp values were not . the igf-ii levels in cord serum were 50 % higher in the infants of diabetic than in those of nondiabetic mothers . these findings raise the questions of whether maternal smbp levels influence the amount of igf-i available for the fetal-placental unit and whether igf-ii participates in glucose homeostasis in the fetus . 
the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency in infancy . the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency in infancy is reported for the first time in three male pseudohermaphrodites from the dominican republic . basal plasma testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ratios were significantly elevated in two of the three affected infants , and increased markedly in all three infants after administration of hcg . since urinary etiocholanolone to androsterone ratios could not be determined accurately in this age group , the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was confirmed by the finding of elevated urinary tetrahydrocortisol ( thf ) to 5 alpha-tetrahydrocortisol ( 5 alpha-thf ) ratios , as determined by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry , in the affected male infants compared to those in age-matched normal infants . the thf / 5 alpha-thf ratios , however , were lower in both the normal children and the affected infants , suggesting increased 5 alpha-reductase activity in infancy . the affected infants had thf / 5 alpha-thf ratios comparable to ratios in adult carrier males and significantly lower than ratios in adult homozygotes . two of the three affected infants are related to the large dominican kindred we studied previously and initially were raised as females but , after parental counseling , were changed to a male sex of rearing . 
sensitive and specific assay for human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) based on anti-peptide and anti-hcg monoclonal antibodies : construction and clinical implications . we developed a highly sensitive and specific assay for hcg using monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) directed against a 37-amino acid synthetic polypeptide analogous to the carboxyl-terminus ( ctp ) of beta hcg . five antibodies that varied by either their affinity for beta hcg or their specificity for epitopes on ctp were investigated . to measure hormone levels , we used as the radiolabeled indicator an alpha-subunit-reactive mab . the monoclonal-immunoradiometric assay had a lower limit of sensitivity of 0.05 ng / ml . serum levels of hcg or hcg-like material with ctp structure were measured in 229 healthy blood donors ; 1.1 % of healthy men and 4.6 % of nonpregnant women younger than 50 yr had serum values varying between 0.05 and 0.23 ng / ml . moreover , 6 to 7 healthy women older than 50 yr had detectable levels in the 0.05-0.20 ng / ml range . to study the disappearance rates in normal women , we followed serum hcg serum levels of 6 women who had previously received a single im injection of the hormone . these individuals failed to develop a pregnancy after in vitro fertilization ; hcg declined from 0.5 to 0.05 ng / ml within 2 weeks . these results were in contrast to the findings in 12 patients with hcg-producing tumors . in 9 patients without any evidence of recurrent disease , hcg levels became undetectable within 5 months . however , 3 others had levels consistently above 0.05 but below 0.5 ng / ml . in 2 of these three patients , subsequent increasing hcg levels were associated with tumor recurrence . we conclude that this hcg assay based on both anti-peptide and anti-hcg mabs may be useful in tumor monitoring . 
familial cortisol resistance : differential diagnostic and therapeutic aspects . a 26-yr-old woman presented with hirsutism , male pattern scalp baldness ( " geheimratsecken " ) , and menstrual irregularities . she had no hypertension or other signs and symptoms of cushing 's syndrome . plasma cortisol levels were greatly elevated and did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone . cortisol binding to transcortin was normal . plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels were also increased , but 17-hydroxyprogesterone and aldosterone levels were normal . further studies revealed an increased cortisol production rate , increased 24-h urinary cortisol excretion , increased plasma acth levels , a normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol at an elevated level , and normal increments of plasma acth , cortisol , gh , and prl in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia . the father and two brothers also had increased plasma cortisol levels , which did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone . chronic therapy with dexamethasone ( at first 1 and later 0.5 mg , three times daily ) for more than 30 weeks resulted in decreased hirsutism , normalization of scalp hair and menstrual cyclicity , and normal plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels . no signs or symptoms of cushing 's syndrome developed , and the central regulation of secretion of acth , cortisol , gh , and prl ( insulin test , diurnal rhythm ) remained qualitatively normal at a lower set-point . we conclude that this patient had autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary ( partial ) cortisol insensitivity , which had resulted in increased adrenocortical cortisol and androgen secretion . the latter had not resulted in clinical symptoms in the three afflicted male members of the family , but had in the propositus . the results also indicate the potential usefulness of the insulin test in distinguishing this disorder from cushing 's disease . 
differences in the interaction between dopamine and estradiol on prolactin release by cultured normal and tumorous human pituitary cells . we studied the interaction between dopamine and estradiol on prl release by cultured normal and tumorous prl-secreting cells prepared from human pituitaries . if pituitary glands were obtained within 3 h after sudden death of previously normal individuals , the viability of isolated pituitary cells prepared by dispersion with dispase was more than 75 % . after 4 days of culture , dopamine ( 500 nm ) inhibited prl release by cells prepared from four normal pituitaries by 24 + / - 3 % ( + / - sem ) . pretreatment of the cells with 100 nm estradiol did not alter dopamine-mediated inhibition of prl release . estradiol alone increased basal prl release and cell prl content . cultured prl-secreting pituitary tumor cells , obtained by transsphenoidal operation from four patients , were similarly sensitive to dopamine . estradiol stimulated tumor cell prl release and content , but significantly diminished the inhibitory effect of dopamine . the estrogen receptor blocker tamoxifen did not alter prl release , but it did reverse the estradiol-induced insensitivity of the prolactinoma cells to the dopamine agonist bromocriptine . in conclusion , these in vitro results indicate that estrogens do not antagonize the effect of dopamine on normal human prl-secreting pituitary cells . in human pituitary tumor cells , however , estradiol decreased the sensitivity of prl release to dopamine ( agonists ) , and the estrogen action can be acutely reversed by tamoxifen . 
pharmacokinetic properties of testosterone propionate in normal men . the pharmacokinetic characteristics of testosterone propionate were studied in normal men after a single im dose of 25 mg testosterone propionate-19 , 19 , 19-d3 . plasma levels of testosterone propionate-19 , 19 , 19-d3 , its active metabolite testosterone-19 , 19 , 19-d3 , and endogenous testosterone were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry . testosterone propionate-19 , 19 , 19-d3 was gradually transferred from the im injection site to the systemic circulation . the plasma levels of testosterone propionate-19 , 19 , 19-d3 were maintained at 2-4 ng / ml between 3 and 36 h after administration . plasma testosterone-19 , 19 , 19-d3 levels were maintained above the physiological testosterone level for 48 h , while plasma levels of endogenous testosterone changed little . 
use of ketoconazole in the treatment of cushing 's syndrome . the therapeutic value of ketoconazole for long term treatment of patients with cushing 's syndrome was studied . seven patients with cushing 's disease and one with an adrenal adenoma received 600-800 mg / day ketoconazole for 3-13 months . plasma acth , cortisol , and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels and urinary cortisol , 17-ketosteroid , and tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion were determined periodically during the treatment period . plasma acth and cortisol responses to crh stimulation were determined before and during treatment . rapid and subsequently persistent clinical improvement occurred in each patient ; plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and urinary 17-ketosteroid and cortisol excretion decreased soon after the initiation of treatment , subsequently remaining normal or nearly so throughout the treatment period . urinary tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion increased significantly . plasma cortisol levels decreased . plasma acth levels did not change , and individual plasma acth and cortisol increments in response to crh were comparable before and during treatment . the cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia improved in one patient and was restored to normal in another . the seven patients tested recovered normal adrenal suppressibility in response to a low dose of dexamethasone during ketoconazole treatment . ketoconazole is effective for long term control of hypercortisolism of either pituitary or adrenal origin . its effect appears to be mediated by inhibition of adrenal 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17 , 20-lyase , and it , in some unknown way , prevents the expected rise in acth secretion in patients with cushing 's disease . 
localization and molecular forms of galanin in human adrenals : elevated levels in pheochromocytomas . galanin immunoreactivity was measured by ria , using antibodies directed against both the non-c- and c-terminal positions of porcine galanin , in tissue extracts of normal adrenals and pheochromocytomas and also in the plasma of normal subjects and patients with pheochromocytomas . no c-terminal galanin-like immunoreactivity was detected in plasma or tissue , suggesting differences in the amino acid sequence of human compared with porcine galanin . a non-c-terminally directed antibody was , therefore , used to characterize human galanin immunoreactivity by gel permeation chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and to localize it by immunocytochemistry . the galanin content of whole adrenal gland was 2.6 + / - 0.9 ( + / - sem ) pmol / g ( n = 5 ) . in contrast , however , pheochromocytomas had much greater concentrations ( 21 + / - 2.3 pmol / g ; n = 16 ) . gel chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography revealed 2 molecular forms of galanin immunoreactivity with identical elution positions in both normal adrenals and tumors . the concentration of galanin in plasma from both normal subjects and pheochromocytoma patients was below the detection limit of the assay ( less than 10 pmol / liter ) . using immunocytochemistry , galanin was localized to scattered cells or clusters of tumor cells in 5 of 11 pheochromocytomas and only a few chromaffin cells and cortical nerve fibers in normal adrenals . 
parathyroid localization . twenty-nine consecutive patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism were examined preoperatively using ultrasound , sonographically guided fine needle aspiration , and aspirate immunostaining for pth . in 25 patients , localization of enlarged parathyroid glands was successful . in 2 patients , the tumors were located retrosternally and , thus , could not be detected by ultrasound . one patient had a multinodular goiter which impeded localization . in 1 patient with renal osteodystrophy , 2 enlarged parathyroid glands in the neck were not visualized preoperatively . cytology was not diagnostic , although some cytological features were suggestive of parathyroid cells . immunostaining of the aspirated smears for pth , however , correctly diagnosed all preoperatively localized lesions . ultrasound should be the routine procedure of choice for preoperative localization of abnormal parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism . fine needle aspiration and immunocytochemistry can supply confirmation , if necessary . 
effect of free fatty acids on the concentration of free thyroxine in human serum : the role of albumin . the concentration of ffa in normal human plasma in vivo generally ranges between 0.2 and 0.7 meq / liter ; slightly higher concentrations have occasionally been reported in patients who are seriously ill . to determine whether such ffa concentrations may increase the concentration of free t4 in serum , we added increasing amounts of oleic acid to pooled normal human serum ( with known ffa content ) and measured free t4 by equilibrium dialysis . total ffa up to 3 meq / liter in normal serum , representing an ffa to albumin molar ratio of about 5 : 1 , had little or no effect on the free t4 concentration , while higher ffa concentrations progressively increased free t4 . this same molar ratio of ffa to albumin had to be exceeded to cause a significant increase in the free t4 concentration in diluted serum and in serum from patients with nonthyroid illness . serum from which more than 95 % of the albumin had been removed by chromatography with affi-gel blue was much more sensitive to the effects of ffa on free t4 . this enhanced sensitivity was reversed by readdition of albumin to the serum , and the addition of albumin to normal serum resulted in diminished effects of ffa on free t4 . these results indicate the following : physiological concentrations of ffa do not significantly increase the free t4 concentration in normal human serum ; when ffa reach supraphysiological concentrations in serum ( in vitro ) and the higher affinity ffa-binding sites on albumin become saturated ( apparently at an ffa to albumin molar ratio of approximately 5 : 1 ) , the excess ffa interact with other serum proteins , including thyroid hormone-binding globulin , and thereby increase the free t4 concentration ; the concentration of albumin ( or other ffa binders ) must be considered when evaluating the observed effects of ffa . to explore the relevance of these findings to the hypothesis that ffa may inhibit the binding of t4 to plasma proteins in patients with nonthyroid illness , we measured plasma ffa concentrations in 11 severely ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit . we found a mean plasma ffa concentration of 0.45 + / - 0.11 ( + / - sem ) meq / liter and a mean serum albumin concentration of 2.39 + / - 0.29 g / dl in these patients . their mean plasma ffa to albumin molar ratio was 1.53 + / - 0.41 . since the ffa to albumin molar ratio must exceed about approximately 5 : 1 before a significant increase in the serum free t4 concentration occurs , these results suggest that ffa do not commonly influence the circulating free t4 concentration in vivo , even in severely ill patients . 
decreased bioavailable testosterone in aging normal and impotent men . tissue available ( bioavailable ) testosterone ( t ) includes circulating free t ( ft ) and albumin-bound t . a reasonable assessment of bioavailable t can be made by using 50 % ammonium sulfate to precipitate sex hormone-binding globulin ( shbg ) -bound t . the supernatant non-shbg-bound t ( non-shbg-t ) correlates well with physiological androgen activity . to assess bioavailable t in normal aging men , we analyzed serum samples from seven healthy aged men ( 65-83 yr old ) and compared the results to samples from 13 young men ( 22-39 yr old ) . mean serum t , ft , and lh concentrations were not significantly different in the 2 groups . however , the mean absolute non-shbg-t level was significantly lower ( p less than 0.005 ) in the older group . in a separate population of 20 impotent but otherwise healthy men ( 5 27-37 yr old , 10 48-64 yr old , and 5 66-69 yr old ) , the mean absolute non-shbg-t concentration was lower in middle-aged ( p less than .01 ) and elderly men ( p less than 0.001 ) than in young men . the absolute ft was lower only in the elderly group ( p less than 0.05 ) , while mean lh and t levels were similar in all 3 age groups . these data suggest that serum concentrations of tissue available t are decreased in aged men and that non-shbg-t measurement is a more sensitive indicator of this decrease than are serum t or serum ft measurements . these changes appear to begin by middle age . 
25-hydroxyvitamin d3 metabolism by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated normal human macrophages . cultured normal human pulmonary alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages were studied for their capacity to metabolize [ 3h ] 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 ( 25ohd3 ) . incubation of macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) resulted in the conversion of [ 3h ] 25ohd3 to a more polar vitamin d3 metabolite ( up to 15 pmol / 10 ( 6 ) cells ) . untreated macrophages did not synthesize this metabolite . several findings suggested that the metabolite was the biologically active form of vitamin d3 , namely 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 [ 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 ] . ( 1 ) the metabolite comigrated with chemically synthesized 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 on four different high performance liquid chromatographic systems . ( 2 ) the metabolite had the same affinity for the chick intestinal 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 receptor as authentic 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 . ( 3 ) the biological activity of the macrophage metabolite in vivo ( stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization in rachitic chicks ) was identical to the activity of chemically synthesized 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3 . the lps-stimulated synthesis of the 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3-like compound by macrophages was dose dependent in a linear fashion ; a half-maximal response was typically found with 100-200 ng lps / 10 ( 6 ) cells . polymyxin b abolished the effects of lps on 25ohd3 metabolism in macrophages . our data suggest that lps-stimulated macrophages can modulate , on a local level , the function of 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3-responsive cells by releasing the 1 , 25- ( oh ) 2d3-like metabolite . 
treatment of neonatal hyperthyroidism due to graves ' disease with sodium ipodate . we describe the effect of administration of repeated doses of sodium ipodate in a newborn infant with hyperthyroidism due to transient graves ' disease . pretreatment ( day 3 ) serum t4 and t3 concentrations were 49 micrograms / dl and 590 ng / dl , respectively . with 24 h after the first dose of ipodate , serum t3 fell by 40 % , and it subsequently ranged from 209-278 ng / dl throughout the 39-day ipodate treatment period . serum t4 also decreased after ipodate administration to 69 % and 41 % of the pretreatment value after 72 h and 7 days of treatment , respectively ; values thereafter during treatment ranged from 19-22 micrograms / dl . these plateau values are in the upper range of normal for the neonatal period . rapid clinical improvement occurred as the hyperiodothyroninemia abated . serum rt3 concentrations increased from 468-672 ng / dl to greater than 1400 ng / dl 24 h after each ipodate dose . thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin was present in maternal and cord sera , and the half-life of serum thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin in the infant was approximately 12 days . antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies were present in the infant at 10 days of age , and the titers decreased progressively thereafter ; the half-life for the antimicrosomal antibody titer was 3 weeks . the data suggest that sodium ipodate can be useful for treatment of neonatal hyperthyroidism due to graves ' disease . 
inhibition of thyrotropin-induced growth of rat thyroid cells , frtl-5 , by immunoglobulin g from patients with primary myxedema . we studied thyroid growth-blocking activity in immunoglobulin g ( igg ) fractions of serum from 24 patients with primary myxedema , 24 patients with goitrous hashimoto 's thyroiditis , and 18 normal subjects by measuring the ability of their igg to inhibit tsh-induced [ 3h ] thymidine incorporation into dna in a rat thyroid cell line , frtl-5 . both groups of patients were receiving t4 when studied . [ 3h ] thymidine incorporation induced by 0.1 mu / ml bovine tsh was significantly inhibited by the addition of 2 mg / ml igg from patients with primary myxedema ( p less than 0.01 ) , while it was not affected by igg from the normal subjects or 23 of the 24 patients with goitrous hashimoto 's thyroiditis . igg from patients with primary myxedema also inhibited the [ 3h ] thymidine incorporation induced by graves ' igg , but not that induced by forskolin , cholera toxin , ( bu ) 2camp or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate . the inhibition of tsh-induced [ 3h ] thymidine incorporation by iggs from patients with primary myxedema was significantly correlated with their inhibitory activities against both tsh-induced camp generation and tsh binding ( p less than 0.001 ) . these data indicate that these growth-blocking antibodies are directed against the tsh receptor and might be one of the causes of the thyroid atrophy in patients with primary myxedema . 
steroidogenesis in the human fetal adrenal : a role for cholesterol synthesized de novo . primary monolayer cultures of human fetal adrenal cells maintained in either lipoprotein-depleted or lipoprotein-supplemented media responded chronically to acth treatment with similarly increased steroid secretion . the principal steroid secreted into each medium was dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate . the presence of human low density lipoprotein ( hldl ) in the medium enhanced the secretion of nonsulfoconjugated steroids , especially dehydroepiandrosterone . the secretion rate of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was similar to that of cortisol . in the absence of hldl , acth increased cholesterologenesis to maintain the high rates of steroid secretion . after acth treatment , increased accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase , a rate-determining enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis , was found . immunoblot analysis demonstrated that this enzyme was a 97k protein in human fetal adrenal cells . interestingly , the content of this enzyme in cells treated with acth in lipoprotein-depleted medium was similar to that in adrenal fetal zone tissue . this finding suggests that cholesterologenesis de novo in addition to plasma ldl is important as a source of steroid precursor in vivo in the human fetal adrenal gland . 
the effect of luteal phase estrogen antagonism on luteinizing hormone pulsatility and luteal function in women . pulsatile lh secretion was studied to determine if the frequency of lh pulses was altered by the administration of clomiphene citrate ( cc ; 150 mg ) for 5 days during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle . seven normal women received cc or placebo in alternate cycles in a randomized double blind fashion . on the day after drug administration , blood samples were obtained at 15-min intervals for 8 h for serum lh determinations . daily blood samples were also obtained throughout the luteal phase for determination of serum lh , estradiol ( e2 ) , and progesterone . lh pulse frequency increased from 2.4 + / - 0.5 ( + / - sem ) / 8 h after placebo to 3.9 + / - 0.6 / 8 h ( p less than 0.01 ) after cc treatment , but pulse amplitude did not change . the transverse mean of serum lh was higher after cc ( 13.6 + / - 0.5 miu / ml ) than after placebo ( 8.4 + / - 0.3 miu / ml ; p less than 0.001 ) , and luteal phase length was increased from 13.5 + / - 0.5 to 16.0 + / - 0.4 days ( p less than 0.001 ) by administration of cc . luteal phase levels of e2 and progesterone measured daily were significantly elevated ( p less than 0.01 ) in cc-treated cycles . these findings suggest that cc increases the frequency of hypothalamic gnrh secretory episodes , perhaps by an action involving a decrease in endogenous opioid peptide activity . since peripheral progesterone levels were elevated in the cc-treated cycles , e2 may play a permissive role in the ability of progesterone to increase endogenous opioid peptide activity acutely . furthermore , since the luteal phase was significantly prolonged by an increase in endogenous lh pulse frequency , the slow frequency of lh pulses in the normal late luteal phase may contribute to the onset of luteolysis in the human . 
estradiol , estriol , progesterone , prolactin , and human chorionic gonadotropin in pregnant women with alcohol abuse . serum estradiol , estriol , progesterone , prl , and hcg concentrations were measured at 4-week intervals in 40 pregnant women who chronically abused alcohol and in 20 abstinent pregnant women . sixteen alcohol users gave birth to infants with the fetal alcohol syndrome ( fas ) , whereas the remaining 24 infants of alcohol users and all infants of the abstinent women were healthy . the women whose infants had the fas had decreased estradiol and estriol levels throughout pregnancy . progesterone levels also tended to be low . in contrast , the alcohol users had increased prl levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy compared with those in the abstinent women , but this rise was not related to the fas . the concentrations of hcg fluctuated widely , without any consistent difference between alcohol users and abstinent women . thus , heavy maternal abuse of alcohol resulting in fas is accompanied , primarily or secondarily , by reduced estrogen concentrations throughout pregnancy and increased prl levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy . 
effect of 64-hour sleep deprivation on the circadian waveform of thyrotropin ( tsh ) : further evidence of sleep-related inhibition of tsh release . half-hourly sampling of plasma tsh was done across 3 days in four normal young men . sleep was denied for 64 h from 0700 h on awakening from accommodation sleep until polygraphic sleep was resumed at 7100 h of the third day ( d3 ) such that 2 consecutive nights of usual 2300-0700 h sleep were missed . this protocol allowed examination of any modulatory effects on the daily patterns in tsh concentrations during sleep deprivation on d1-2 ( 1100-3500 , 3500-5900 h ) or during resumption of usual nightly sleep on d3 ( 5900-8300 ) compared to that of a previously studied group of normal young men . the circadian nature of the daily tsh waveform was evidenced by its daily repetition within a subject both basally and during d1-2 sleep deprivation and by its synchronization within the basal , deprived , or resumed sleep days . the peaks in each subject 's daily tsh patterns on d1-2 were consistently longer , and the daily maxima and cosine acrophases on d1-2 were consistently later than those on d3 when basal sleep was resumed . about half the daily tsh concentration maxima and daily cosinor amplitudes on d1-2 were greater than those of the respective sleep-resumed tsh patterns of d3 . both the group mean tsh patterns and the cosinor 95 % confidence ellipses also indicated the daily peak in the tsh waveform to be significantly longer , later , and larger during d1-2 sleep deprivation than during the basal or d3 periods . these results indicate that significant alteration of the daily tsh waveform can occur in response to absence of sleep and are compatible with the existence of an inhibitory effect in early nightly sleep on tsh release . the tsh patterns during the 1700-2300 h intervals of rising tsh levels were congruent in the basal , deprived , and resumed sleep periods . prompt reversion to the basal tsh pattern also occurred when sleep was resumed on d3 . both of these observations suggest the alteration in tsh waveform during sleep deprivation to have arisen from an inhibitory effect in sleep rather than from a change in period or phase of a generating oscillator . 
resistance to insulin suppression of plasma free fatty acid concentrations and insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus . the ability of insulin to stimulate tissue glucose uptake and lower plasma ffa concentrations was quantified in 12 individuals with normal glucose tolerance and 12 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( niddm ) , further subdivided into obese and nonobese subjects . measurements were made during 5-h glucose clamp studies , carried out at plasma insulin concentrations of about 10 microu / ml ( 0-150 min ) and about 60 microu / ml ( 150-300 min ) . differences between the patient groups were compared by two-way analysis of variance . the ability of insulin to either suppress plasma ffa concentrations or stimulate glucose uptake was significantly reduced ( p less than 0.001 ) in patients with niddm , and this was true of both the obese and nonobese groups . the defect in the ability of insulin to suppress plasma ffa concentrations in patients with niddm was more apparent at the lower insulin concentration , whereas resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in niddm was more dramatic at the high insulin concentration . finally , a significant correlation ( r = -0.67 ; p less than 0.001 ) between insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and plasma ffa concentration was found in the entire group . these data emphasize the fact that patients with niddm are resistant to multiple actions of insulin , and that the magnitudes of the defect in insulin suppression of plasma ffa levels and stimulation of tissue glucose uptake are roughly comparable . 
cyclical edema and hypokalemia due to occult episodic hypercorticism . yearly episodes of edema , hypokalemia , anxiety , and depression were found to be due to cortisol and deoxycorticosterone surges secondary to a pituitary adenoma in a woman without any of the usual clinical features of cushing 's syndrome . during the long clinical remissions , she had no recognizable laboratory abnormality . she had two episodes in the year following incomplete transphenoidal pituitary tumor resection , but has had none in 2 yr since receiving radiotherapy . the episodes were caused by mineralocorticoid actions of large acth-induced increases in cortisol and deoxycorticosterone secretion . a history of episodic edema and hypokalemia , often attributed in women to surreptitious diuretic abuse , requires a careful search for hypercorticism even in the absence of clinical cushing 's syndrome . 
circulating 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d concentrations in patients with renal cell carcinoma-associated hypercalcemia are rarely suppressed . we measured serum 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d concentrations in 18 patients with renal cell carcinoma-associated hypercalcemia . only 2 patients ( 11 % ) had low serum 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d ( less than 15 pg / ml ) levels , and the mean 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d level in the 18 patients was 44 + / - 30 ( + / - sd ) pg / ml , not different from the value of 42 + / - 22 pg / ml in 75 age-matched normocalcemic patients with various malignancies . eighty-seven percent ( 26 of 30 ) of the hypercalcemic patients with extensive skeletal metastases due to other malignancies or with hematological malignancies had suppressed serum 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d levels ( less than 15 pg / ml ) . in hypercalcemic patients with other malignancies and no skeletal metastases , only 54 % ( 21 of 39 ) had low serum 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d levels . the mean serum 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d level in the latter group was 21 + / - 26 pg / ml , significantly lower than that in normocalcemic patients . in renal cell carcinoma-associated hypercalcemia , suppression of circulating 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d concentrations is uncommon . 
the effects of hyperinsulinemia on serum testosterone , progesterone , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate , and cortisol levels in normal women and in a woman with hyperandrogenism , insulin resistance , and acanthosis nigricans . insulin may mediate the hyperandrogenism that frequently occurs in patients with insulin-resistant states . to test this hypothesis , we studied five normal women and one woman with hyperandrogenism , insulin resistance , and acanthosis nigricans with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique . each woman received a 0.1 u / kg insulin bolus dose , followed by a 10 mu / kg x min insulin infusion for 12-16 h . in the normal women , an average insulin level of 1832 + / - 292 ( + / - sem ) microu / ml was achieved ; serum glucose was clamped at 116 + / - 5 mg / dl . at this level , insulin may bind to the insulin-like growth factor i receptor as well as to its own receptor . contrary to our working hypothesis , a rise in serum testosterone did not occur in any women during insulin infusion , and in one women , serum testosterone levels decreased . when analyzed as a percentage of the basal value , serum progesterone levels fell 20 % in the normal women within the first 2 h of insulin infusion , but did not change thereafter . dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( dhea-s ) levels , however , uniformly and progressively decreased by 39 % after 12 h of insulin infusion in the normal women and by 31 % at 14 h in the woman with hyperandrogenism , insulin resistance , and acanthosis nigricans . the fall in serum dhea-s levels was not due to diurnal rhythmicity , as the changes in serum dhea-s levels did not correlated with those in serum cortisol . suppression of prl release also was excluded as a cause of the fall in dhea-s levels . these results indicate that acute hyperinsulinemia of 12- to 16-h duration does not increase serum testosterone or dhea-s concentrations and , indeed , can cause a decline in serum dhea-s levels in both normal women and the single woman studied with hyperandrogenism , insulin resistance , and acanthosis nigricans . 
increased renal sensitivity to vasopressin in two patients with essential hypernatremia . patients with essential hypernatremia maintain urinary concentrating ability despite plasma hyperosmolality and low plasma vasopressin concentrations . we investigated renal sensitivity to ultralow dose vasopressin infusions in two patients with a syndrome of hypodipsia , hypernatremia with selective osmoreceptor dysfunction , early puberty , and aggressive behavior . the patients were water loaded until a hypotonic diuresis was established . vasopressin was infused in stepwise increments from 0.4-12 fmol / kg x min . both patients had increased renal sensitivity to vasopressin , achieving negative free water clearance at infusion rates of 0.4 and 4 fmol / kg x min ( normal greater than or equal to 6 ) . treatment for 3 months with 1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin ( ddavp ) led to an improvement in behavior and the reporting , for the first time , of a sensation of thirst . after ddavp therapy both patients had a reduction of their renal sensitivity to infused vasopressin . we conclude that untreated patients with essential hypernatremia have increased renal sensitivity to vasopressin which is reduced by ddavp administration . 
plasma oxytocin increases in the human sexual response . the purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma oxytocin ( ot ) levels change during human sexual responses and , if so , to demonstrate the temporal pattern of change . plasma ot levels were measured by ria before , during , and after private self-stimulation to orgasm in normal men ( n = 9 ) and women ( n = 13 ) . blood samples were collected continuously through indwelling venous catheters . the subjects pressed a signal to indicate the start and finish of orgasm / ejaculation . objective assessment of sexual arousal and orgasm was obtained by measuring blood-pulse amplitude and electromyographic activity , recorded continuously throughout testing from an anal device containing a photoplethysmograph and electromyograph electrodes connected to a polygraph located in an adjacent room . these measures allowed collection of data from men and women of changes in blood flow and muscle activity in the lower pelvic / pubic area . plasma ot levels increased during sexual arousal in both women and men and were significantly higher during orgasm / ejaculation than during prior baseline testing . we suggest that the temporal pattern of secretion could be related to smooth muscle contractions of the reproductive system during orgasm . 
binding of monoclonal antibody ( 4f2 ) to its cell surface antigen on dispersed adenomatous parathyroid cells raises cytosolic calcium and inhibits parathyroid hormone secretion . in the course of characterizing monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) recognizing cell surface antigens on dispersed human parathyroid cells ( dptcs ) , we identified one mab ( 4f2 ) that bound avidly to parathyroid cells and had marked effects on parathyroid function . the binding of mab 4f2 to human adenomatous dptcs resulted in a marked [ 53.8 + / - 7.9 % ( + / - sem ) ] reduction in low calcium ( ca ) -stimulated pth secretion to levels equivalent to those in cell suppressed by high extracellular ca ( 1.5 mm ) . typically , these functional effects were optimal at antibody dilutions of 1 : 10 ( 4 ) to 1 : 10 ( 5 ) . cell viability was confirmed at the conclusion of each experiment by trypan blue exclusion ( greater than 90-95 % ) and cell surface immunofluorescence . parallel studies using the ca-sensitive dye quin-2 showed that inhibition of pth secretion in 4f2-treated cells was associated with a concomitant increase in cytosolic ca ( cai ) of 188 % in 0.5 mm ca ; these values also approached cai levels in control cells incubated in high ca . mab controls , p3 x 63 , which do not bind to dptcs , and mab lc7-2 , which recognizes a different epitope of the same antigen as 4f2 on dptcs , did not alter pth secretion or cai . immunoprecipitation of 125i-labeled parathyroid cell extracts with mab 4f2 demonstrated proteins with mol wt of approximately 145 , 85 , and 45 under nonreducing conditions and 85 and 45 kilodaltons after reduction with 5 % mercaptoethanol . these studies suggest that 1 ) mab-4f2 binding to its cell surface antigen inhibits pth secretion by human adenomatous parathyroid cells in vitro ; 2 ) the alterations in secretory function could be related to by an attendant increase in cai ; 3 ) the 4f2 antigen on dptcs is a heterodimeric protein of ( approximately ) 85k and 45k ; and 4 ) the 4f2 antigen may be an important component of the ca-sensing and / or signal-transducing mechanism in this cell . 
effects of sex and age on the 24-hour profile of growth hormone secretion in man : importance of endogenous estradiol concentrations . we undertook a study of the separate and combined effects of age and sex on the pulsatile pattern of gh secretion . the 24-h secretory profile of gh was generated by 20-min sampling in 10 young women ( aged 18-33 yr ) , 10 young men ( aged 18-33 yr ) , 8 postmenopausal women ( aged greater than 55 yr ) , and 8 older men ( aged greater than 55 yr ) . a computer-assisted pulse analysis program was used to assess both total gh secretion , as reflected in the 24-h integrated gh concentration ( ighc ) , and pulsatile secretion , as denoted by pulse frequency , duration , amplitude , and the fraction of gh secreted in pulses during the 24-h period ( fghp ) . ighc was significantly greater in women than in men ( p less than 0.025 ) and greater in the young than in the old ( p less than 0.003 ) . the mean pulse amplitude , duration , and fghp were each greater in the young ( p less than 0.006 , p less than 0.03 , and p less than 0.0001 , respectively ) , but not significantly different between the sexes . the mean pulse frequency was not affected by sex or age . the serum concentration of free estradiol , but not free testosterone , correlated with ighc ( r = 0.46 ; p less than 0.005 ) , pulse amplitude ( r = 0.53 ; p less than 0.001 ) , and fghp ( r = 0.59 ; p less than 0.0002 ) . after correcting for the effects of estradiol , neither sex nor age influenced ighc or mean pulse amplitude , while the effect of age on fghp was reduced from 81 % to 29 % . of the indices of gh secretion , fghp had the strongest correlation ( r = 0.43 ; p less than 0.006 ) with somatomedin-c . somatomedin-c declined significantly with age in both sexes . our results indicate that sex and age have independent and interrelated effects on gh secretion . these effects can be largely accounted for by corresponding variations in endogenous estradiol levels . these observations suggest an amplifying action of estradiol on the neuroendocrine regulation of pulsatile gh release . 
angiotensin ii and vasopressin stimulate calcium-activated chloride conductance in rat mesangial cells . in an attempt to clarify the mechanisms by which angiotensin ii ( aii ) and arginine vasopressin ( avp ) regulate mesangial cell function , we examined the membrane potential change of mesangial cells and found that cells contracted and membrane potential depolarized in response to aii and avp . the depolarization was associated with decreased input resistance . ca ionophore a23187 caused similar mesangial cell contraction and depolarization . the reversal potential ( vr ) of the depolarization response to aii and avp was -29 + / - 3 and -25 + / - 7 mv ( mean + / - sd ) , respectively . not only the vr of the aii-induced depolarization but also vr of the ca ionophore-induced response was dependent upon the extracellular cl- concentration . further , aii and avp caused cell contraction and membrane depolarization in ca++-free medium containing 0.5 mm egta . these data suggest the presence of ca++ -activated cl- channels in the mesangial cells and that aii and avp increase cl- permeability via an elevation of [ ca++ ] i released from the intracellular organellae . 
osteogenesis imperfecta type iv . biochemical confirmation of genetic linkage to the pro alpha 2 ( i ) gene of type i collagen . fibroblasts from two affected members of a large pedigree in which osteogenesis imperfecta ( oi ) type iv is genetically linked to the pro alpha 2 ( i ) gene of type i collagen synthesize two populations of pro alpha 2 ( i ) chains . one population is normal ; the second population appears to have a deletion of about 10 amino acid residues from the middle of the triple helical domain . the mutation in pro alpha 2 ( i ) causes increased posttranslational modification in the amino-terminal half of some pro alpha 1 ( i ) chains , lowers the melting temperature of type i collagen molecules that incorporate a mutant pro alpha 2 ( i ) chain , and prevents or delays the secretion of those molecules from fibroblasts in cell culture . on the basis of this study and linkage studies in additional families , it appears that the oi type iv phenotype is often the result of heterozygosity for mutations in pro alpha 2 ( i ) that alter the triple helical structure of type i collagen . 
arterial hemodynamics in human hypertension . differences in aortic impedance between normotensives and hypertensives are not well characterized . we examined impedance in 8 normotensive and 11 hypertensive ( mean 96.7 vs . 122.2 mmhg ) age-matched , chinese patients undergoing cardiac catheterization at rest , during nitroprusside , and handgrip exercise before and after beta blockade ( propranolol ) . hypertensives had higher resistance ( 2 , 295 vs . 1713 dyn-s / cm5 ) , characteristic impedance ( 145.7 vs . 93.9 dyn-s / cm5 ) , total external power ( 1 , 579 vs . 1174 mw ) , peripheral reflections ( ratio of backward to forward wave components of 0.54 vs . 0.44 ) , and first zero crossing of impedance phase angle ( 4.15 vs . 2.97 hz ) . these abnormalities were eliminated with vasodilatation . differences between groups were not further exacerbated when pressure was increased during handgrip exercise . beta blockade further increased resistance and reflections . thus , hemodynamic abnormalities of essential hypertension ( increased resistance , reflections , and pulse wave velocity , and decreased compliance ) are compatible with an increased vasomotor tone that is further unmasked during generalized beta blockade . 
electrogenic sodium / bicarbonate cotransport in rabbit renal cortical basolateral membrane vesicles . the present studies examined the mechanism of bicarbonate transport across basolateral membrane vesicles prepared from rabbit renal cortex . isotopic sodium uptake was stimulated by bicarbonate when compared with gluconate ( 2.5 nmol / mg protein per 5 s versus 1.4 nmol / mg protein per 5 s ) , and this process was inhibited by disulfonic stilbenes . imposition of an interior-positive potassium diffusion potential further stimulated isotopic sodium uptake to 3.4 nmol / mg protein per 5 s , an effect that occurred only in the presence of bicarbonate and was blocked by disulfonic stilbenes . kinetic analysis of the rate of bicarbonate-dependent sodium uptake as a function of sodium concentration revealed saturable stimulation with a vmax of 2.7 nmol / mg protein per 2 s and a km of 10.4 mm . the effect of bicarbonate concentration on bicarbonate-dependent sodium uptake was more complex . the present results demonstrate an electrogenic ( negatively charged ) sodium / bicarbonate cotransporter in basolateral membrane vesicles from the rabbit renal cortex . the electrogenicity implies a stoichiometry of at least two bicarbonate ions for each sodium ion . 
cation depletion by the sodium pump in red cells with pathologic cation leaks . sickle cells and xerocytes . the mechanism by which sickle cells and xerocytic red cells become depleted of cations in vivo has not been identified previously . both types of cells exhibit elevated permeabilities to sodium and potassium , in the case of sickle cells , when deoxygenated . the ouabain-insensitive fluxes of sodium and potassium were equivalent , however , in both cell types under these conditions . when incubated 18 hours in vitro , sickle cells lost cations but only when deoxygenated . this cation depletion was blocked by ouabain , removal of external potassium , or pretreatment with 4 , 4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2 , 2'-disulfonate , which blocks the increase in cation permeability induced by deoxygenation . the loss of cation exhibited by oxygenated xerocytes similarly incubated was also blocked by ouabain . these data support the hypothesis that the elevated " passive " cation fluxes of xerocytes and deoxygenated sickle cells are not directly responsible for cation depletion of these cells ; rather , these pathologic leaks interact with the sodium pump to produce a net loss of cellular cation . 
investigations of the simian ontogenic switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin at the progenitor cell level . the ontogenic switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin could result from discontinuous events , such as replacement of fetal erythroid progenitor cells by adult ones , or gradual modulation of the hemoglobin program of a single progenitor cell pool . the former would result in progenitors at midswitch with skewed fractional beta-globin synthesis programs , the latter in a gaussian distribution . for these studies , we obtained bone marrow from rhesus monkey fetuses at 141-153 d ( midswitch ) . mononuclear cells were cultured in methyl cellulose with erythropoietin , and single bfu-e-derived colonies were removed and incubated with [ 3h ] leucine . globin synthesis was examined by gel electrophoresis and fluorography . the beta-globin synthesis pattern of single fetal colonies was skewed , and did not fit a normal distribution . the fetal pattern resembled the pattern of an artificial mixture of fetal and adult progenitors , suggesting that the fetal progenitor pool could contain populations with different beta-globin programs . this non-gaussian distribution in the progenitors of midswitch fetuses is consistent with a discontinuous model for hemoglobin switching during ontogeny . 
radioimmunoassay of growth hormone-dependent insulinlike growth factor binding protein in human plasma . a specific radioimmunoassay has been established for a growth hormone-dependent insulinlike growth factor ( igf ) binding protein ( bp ) from human plasma . although the assay was directed against a 53-kd , acid-stable bp subunit , the main immunoreactive bp in the circulation had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 125 kd . only higher primate species showed cross-reactivity , and igf-i , igf-ii , and other peptides were without effect . circulating bp levels in healthy subjects rose threefold from early childhood to puberty . in 65 adults aged 18 to 65 , the mean level ( + / - sd ) was 6.12 + / - 1.43 micrograms / ml , and declined with age . strong growth hormone-dependence of bp was also seen ; there was a 2.2-fold increase in active acromegaly and a 50-80 % reduction in growth hormone deficiency . poorly controlled diabetic subjects had bp levels 40 % below normal , whereas in renal failure and third-term pregnancy a mild elevation was seen . measurement of bp may provide a useful adjunct to igf assays in growth disorders . 
association of plasma lipoproteins with postheparin lipase activities . studies were designed to explore the association of lipoprotein lipase ( lpl ) and hepatic triglyceride lipase ( htgl ) activities with lipoproteins in human postheparin plasma ( php ) . the major peak of lpl activity after gel filtration of php eluted after the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and just before the peak of low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol . when php contained chylomicrons , an additional peak of lpl activity eluted in the void volume of the column . most htgl activity eluted after the ldl and preceded the elution of high density lipoprotein cholesterol . lpl activity in preheparin plasma eluted in the same position , relative to lipoproteins , as did lpl in php . gel filtration of purified human milk lpl mixed with plasma or isolated ldl produced a peak of activity eluting before ldl . during gel filtration of php in high salt buffer ( 1 m nacl ) or after isolation of lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation in high salt density solutions , most of the lipase activity was not associated with lipoproteins . lpl activity was removed from php by elution through immunoaffinity columns containing antibodies to apolipoprotein ( apo ) b and apo e . since lipoproteins in php have undergone prior in vivo lipolysis , lpl activity in php may be bound to remnants of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins . 
influence of calcium or 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 supplementation on the hepatic microsomal and in vivo metabolism of vitamin d3 in vitamin d-depleted rats . hypocalcemic vitamin d ( d ) -depleted rats were supplemented with calcium or 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 , and the metabolism of d3 to 25 ( oh ) d3 was studied . infusion with 7 or 65 pmol 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 x 24 h-1 led to normal or slight hypercalcemia associated with physiological and supraphysiological plasma concentrations of the hormone while calcium supplementation normalized plasma calcium despite 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 concentrations as low as those observed in hypocalcemic controls . constant administrations of [ 14c ] d3 during the supplementation regimens uncovered a stimulation of the in vivo 25 ( oh ) d3 production by calcium supplementation ; this was further confirmed in vitro by an increase in the hepatic microsomal d3-25 hydroxylase . the group supplemented with pharmacological doses of the hormone displayed lower circulating concentrations of both d3 and 25 ( oh ) d3 while the in vitro 25 ( oh ) d3 production remained unaffected by 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 . investigation of the kinetics of intravenous 25 ( oh ) [ 3h ] d3 revealed similar elimination constants in all groups . the data indicate that calcium supplementation of hypocalcemic d-depleted rats results in an increased transformation of d3 into 25 ( oh ) d3 while supplementation with 1 , 25 ( oh ) 2d3 does not affect the in vitro d3-25 hydroxylase but seems to influence the in vivo handling of the vitamin by accelerating its metabolism . 
axial heterogeneity of bicarbonate , chloride , and water transport in the rat proximal convoluted tubule . effects of change in luminal flow rate and of alkalemia . these studies examined regulation of superficial proximal convoluted tubule ( pct ) transport as a function of length . when single nephron glomerular filtration rate ( sngfr ) increased from 28.7 + / - 0.7 nl / min in hydropenia to 41.5 + / - 0.4 nl / min in euvolemia , bicarbonate , chloride , and water reabsorption in the early ( 1st mm ) pct increased proportionally : from 354 + / - 21 peq / mm x min , 206 + / - 55 peq / mm x min , and 5.9 + / - 0.4 nl / mm x min to 520 + / - 12 peq / mm x min , 585 + / - 21 peq / mm x min , and 10.1 + / - 0.4 nl / mm x min , respectively . these high transport rates did not increase further , however , when sngfr went to 51.2 + / - 0.7 or 50.7 + / - 0.6 nl / min after atrial natriuretic factor or glucagon administration . anion and water transport rates in the late pct were lower and exhibited less flow dependence . during chronic metabolic alkalosis , acidification was inhibited in the late but not early pct . in conclusion , the early pct is distinguished from the late pct by having high-capacity , flow-responsive but saturable , anion- and water-reabsorptive processes relatively unaffected by alkalemia . 
determinants of 24-hour energy expenditure in man . methods and results using a respiratory chamber . daily human energy requirements calculated from separate components of energy expenditure are inaccurate and usually in poor agreement with measured energy intakes . measurement of energy expenditure over periods of 24 h or longer is needed to determine more accurately rates of daily energy expenditure in humans . we provide a detailed description of a human respiratory chamber and methods used to determine rates of energy expenditure over 24-h periods in 177 subjects . the results show that : fat-free mass ( ffm ) as estimated by densitometry is the best available determinant of 24-h energy expenditures ( 24ee ) and explains 81 % of the variance observed between individuals ( 24ee [ kcal / d ] = 597 + 26.5 ffm ) ; 24ee in an individual is very reproducible ( coefficient of variation = 2.4 % ) ; and even when adjusted for differences in ffm , there is still considerable interperson variability of the daily energy expenditure . a large portion of the variability of 24ee among individuals , independent of differences in body size , was due to variability in the degree of spontaneous physical activity , i.e. , " fidgeting , " which accounted for 100-800 kcal / d in these subjects . 
cotton dust-mediated lung epithelial injury . to determine if constituents of cotton plants might play a role in byssinosis by injuring pulmonary epithelium , we added extracts of cotton dust , green bract , and field-dried bract to human a549 and rat type ii pneumocytes . injury was measured as pneumocyte lysis and detachment , and inhibition of protein synthesis . extracts of cotton dust and field-dried bract produced significant dose- and time-dependent lysis and detachment of both target cells , while green bract extract was less damaging . extracts treated with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone to remove tannins produced significantly less injury . in contrast , purified 5 , 7 , 3 ' , 4'-tetrahydroxy-flavan 3 , 4-diol ( thf ) , a tannin in cotton dust and bract , caused substantial cell damage . field-dried bract extract and thf also produced dose-dependent inhibition of pneumocyte protein synthesis . endotoxin levels did not correlate with observed injury . thf added to rat tracheal explants caused epithelial disruption and desquamation , whereas endotoxin did not . instillation of cotton dust and field-dried bract extract in rat lungs produced disruption of bronchial epithelium and smooth muscle constriction , while polyvinylpolypyrrolidone-treated cotton dust extract produced no injury . these findings suggest that extracts of cotton plants are toxic to alveolar , tracheal , and bronchial epithelium and that thf or other tannins may be the responsible agents . 
attachment of human c5a des arg to its cochemotaxin is required for maximum expression of chemotactic activity . the chemotactic activity of human c5a des arg is enhanced significantly by an anionic polypeptide ( cochemotaxin ) in normal human serum and plasma . we have found that the cochemotaxin attaches to the oligosaccharide chain of native c5a des arg to form a complex with potent chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes . although capable of enhancing the chemotactic activity of native c5a des arg , the cochemotaxin had no effect on the chemotactic activity of either deglycosylated c5a des arg , native c5a , or n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine . of the known components of the oligosaccharide chain , only sialic acid prevented enhancement by the cochemotaxin of the chemotactic activity exhibited by native c5a des arg . sialic acid also prevented the formation of c5a des arg-cochemotaxin complexes , detected by acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , molecular sieve chromatography on polyacrylamide gels , and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation . 
enhancement of secretagogue-induced phosphoinositide turnover and amylase secretion by bile acids in isolated rat pancreatic acini . small amounts ( 0.1-0.5 mm ) of deoxycholate enhanced amylase secretion , which had been induced by submaximal doses of carbachol or cholecystokinin octapeptide , without affecting the maximal levels of these reactions from isolated rat pancreatic acini . deoxycholate alone did not induce these reactions . the other bile acids such as cholate , chenodeoxycholate , ursodeoxycholate , and taurocholate were also active . under the similar conditions , deoxycholate enhanced the secretagogue-induced diacylglycerol formation that was derived mainly from the phospholipase c-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate . deoxycholate did not enhance the secretagogue-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate or ca2+ mobilization . deoxycholate did not affect amylase secretion , which was induced by the simultaneous addition of protein kinase c-activating 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and ca2+ ionophore ionomycin . since diacylglycerol and ca2+ may be responsible for the secretagogue-induced amylase secretion , our results indicate that small amounts of bile acids increase the sensitivity to the secretagogue of diacylglycerol formation and subsequent activation of protein kinase c , and thereby enhance amylase secretion from pancreatic acini . 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated anion transport in rabbit cortical collecting duct . kinetics , stoichiometry , and conductive pathways . cyclic amp stimulates hco3 secretion and cl self-exchange in rabbit cortical collecting tubule . we found that varying peritubular [ cl ] changed the cl self-exchange rate with saturation kinetics ( km , 3-4 mm ) . hco3 secretion also showed saturation kinetics as a function of mean luminal [ cl ] ( km , 4-11 mm ) . both cl self-exchange and cl-hco3 exchange thus appear to be carrier-mediated . addition / removal of basolateral hco3 qualitatively changed cl and hco3 transport as expected for cl-hco3 exchange , but quantitatively changed cl absorption more than hco3 secretion . the diffusive cl permeability and the transepithelial conductance in the presence of hco3 / co2 and camp were higher than in their absence suggesting that hco3 / co2 and camp together increase a conductive cl pathway parallel to a 1 : 1 cl-hco3 exchanger . thus , camp not only stimulates the overall process of anion exchange ( probably by increasing an electroneutral exchanger and / or a series cl conductance ) , but also stimulates a cl conductance parallel to the exchange process . 
correlation between pathogenicity and temperature sensitivity in different strains of histoplasma capsulatum . we compared the mycelial to yeast transitions of the downs strain of histoplasma capsulatum ( low level of virulence ) with those of g184a and g222b , two more virulent strains having different levels of pathogenicity for mice . when the morphological transitions are initiated by a temperature shift from 25 degrees to 37 degrees c , all three strains undergo similar physiological changes , but these are less severe in g184a and g222b than in the downs strain . the transitions from mycelial to yeast morphology in both of the more virulent strains are also one-third more rapid than in downs . we also find that the differences in temperature sensitivity of the three strains can be correlated with the temperature required for complete uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation . the differences in sensitivity to elevated temperatures extend to the growth of yeast cells of all three strains . considered together , our results suggest that sensitivity to elevated temperatures may be a key factor accounting for differences in virulence and that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation may be the primary event in the morphological transition in all three strains . 
molecular defect in the membrane skeleton of blood bank-stored red cells . abnormal spectrin-protein 4.1-actin complex formation . during liquid preservation under blood bank conditions , red cell membranes inexorably undergo damage that decreases erythrocyte survival after transfusion . accordingly , we have surveyed membrane skeletal protein interactions during storage . we uncovered a decrease in the in vitro formation of spectrin-actin complex in the absence ( 50 % ) or presence ( 60 % ) of protein 4.1 . actual formation of the spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 complex fell in a linear fashion during the storage period . this fall in spectrin-actin interaction tightly correlated with the decline in total red cell phospholipid ( r = 0.9932 ) measured simultaneously . this decrement of spectrin-actin association could be restored to greater than 70 % of normal values by preincubation of stored spectrin with 50 mm dithiothreitol . this storage injury to spectrin-actin interaction might weaken the membrane skeleton and lead to decreased red cell survival . in vitro reversibility of the damage by reducing agents suggests a possible new direction for prolonging the shelf life of stored blood . 
platelet-activating factor . a potent chemotactic and chemokinetic factor for human eosinophils . platelet-activating factor ( paf-acether ) , an inflammatory mediator with a wide range of biological activities including neutrophil aggregation and chemotaxis , was studied for its effect on human eosinophil locomotion ( chemotaxis and chemokinesis ) . human eosinophils ( 25-95 % purity ) were obtained from donors with a variety of diseases associated with hypereosinophilia . paf-acether elicited directional locomotion of eosinophils , in a time- and dose-dependent fashion , at concentrations from 10 ( -5 ) to 10 ( -8 ) m ; lyso-paf had minimal activity over the same dose range . compared with paf-acether , the eosinophil locomotory responsiveness of leukotriene b4 ( ltb4 ) , histamine , and the valyl- and alanyl-eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis ( ecf-a ) tetrapeptides was negligible . conversely , neutrophil responsiveness to paf-acether ( optimum 10 ( -6 ) m ) was comparable in effect to ltb4 ( optimum dose 10 ( -8 ) m ) . it was shown that paf-acether elicited both chemotaxis and chemokinesis of eosinophils . comparison of normal density and light density eosinophils revealed no qualitative difference in the response to paf-acether and the other chemoattractants , although the light density cells seemed to demonstrate a greater degree of locomotion to paf-acether and ltb4 . thus , paf-acether appears to be a potent eosinophilotactic agent which may play a role in inflammatory reactions characterized by eosinophil infiltration . 
analysis of the apolipoprotein b gene and messenger ribonucleic acid in abetalipoproteinemia . the apolipoprotein b-100 ( apob-100 ) gene in leukocytes and the apob-100 messenger rna ( mrna ) and translated apolipoprotein in the livers from normal and abetalipoproteinemic individuals were evaluated . four complementary dna probes for apob-100 covering the 5 ' , middle , and 3 ' regions of the apob-100 mrna were utilized and southern blot analysis indicated that the apob-100 gene is present in abetalipoproteinemia without major insertions or deletions . polyadenylated hepatic apob-100 mrna from two abetalipoproteinemic patients was normal in size , and the concentration of apob-100 mrna was increased sixfold compared with control hepatic apob-100 mrna levels . apob-100 was detected in hepatocytes of abetalipoproteinemic patients by immunohistochemical techniques . these results indicate that the biochemical defect in abetalipoproteinemic patients studied is most consistent with a posttranslational defect in apob-100 processing or secretion with an up-regulation of the apob-100 mrna . 
identification of a new class of inducible receptors on platelets . thrombospondin interacts with platelets via a gpiib-iiia-independent mechanism . thrombospondin with fibrinogen , fibronectin , and von willebrand factor binds to platelets stimulated with agonists and support platelet adhesive functions . the receptors for the latter three proteins are associated with membrane glycoprotein gpiib-iiia . thrombasthenic platelets deficient in gpiib-iiia have been utilized to examine the role of this membrane protein in the interactions of thrombospondin with platelets . radioiodinated thrombospondin bound to thrombin-stimulated platelets from normal and thrombasthenic donors with a similar affinity and capacity . as monitored with a monoclonal antibody to thrombospondin , the divalent ion-dependent and -independent pathways for the expression of the endogenous pool of thrombospondin on the surface of thrombin-stimulated platelets from normal and thrombasthenic donors were also qualitatively and quantitatively similar . gpiib-iiia or ligands associated with gpiib-iiia thus are not essential for the binding of thrombospondin to platelets . therefore , thrombospondin interacts with unique receptors on platelets . 
plasma enzyme changes in carcinoma of bronchus mimicking myocardial infarction [ letter ] 
colorectal goblet cell sialomucin heterogeneity : its relation to malignant disease . mucus secreted by colorectal cancer differs in three respects from that produced normally : an overall reduction , a loss of o-acetyl substituents in sialic acid , and an increase in neutral mucin . similar changes have been reported in apparently normal mucosa bordering colorectal cancer . " normal " left sided colorectal mucosa from 32 patients with rectal cancer was studied . each case was matched by age and sex to a patient with diverticular disease and a patient with irritable bowel syndrome . twenty five patients with right sided cancer were matched to patients with crohn 's disease . sections were stained with mild periodic acid schiff ( mpas ) ( selectively stains n-acetyl sialic acid lacking in o-acetyl group ) and other closely related techniques . reactions were graded negative , weak , and intense . an intense reaction was found in 9 % of cases ; there was no difference between the various matched groups . phenylhydrazine interposition failed to block the mpas effect , indicating that a positive result was due to a deficiency of sialic acid with o-acetyl substituents rather than neutral mucin . different staining patterns in left and right colon were probably due to differing ratios of total sialic acid : fucose . these findings indicate a hitherto unsuspected colorectal goblet cell sialomucin heterogeneity within the general population , but no association with neoplastic disease is apparent .
